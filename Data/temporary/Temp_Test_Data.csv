70d7c567,0,"Can you imagine living in a place where there is no driving? It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air. Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape. Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere. If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle. To me it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use.

One solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air. In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined. The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home. It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down. The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for. Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was. It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs. The capital city of France also made transportation free MondayFriday to help the cause. Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day.

In Bogota, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world. It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car. People that violated this goal on this day were charged a 25 fine. People from other countries came to see how this day worked and they loved it. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day. Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise. All in all this idea was genius.

As you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place. It is better breathing air, businesses like restaurants and parks would be used more and grow steadily, and the city would be taken care of better."
81977e6c,0,"Limiting car usage could have many advantages on our planet. Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. ""vaughn's streets are completely carfree,except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community."" There is a movement going on called, ""smart planning"" and Vauban is just one example of a growing trend in Europe of limiting auto use. The article says that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. It seems that the people in Europe are realizing that so much car usage is harming their environment, and they are trying to set a trend for other countries like the United States to follow to limit using cars.

How much people use their cars is very important. Polluted air is a very widespread problem in many regions of the world. Paris had days of nearrecord pollution, and decided to enforce a partial driving ban to try to help clear the air of the city. The article says that almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and twentyseven had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog."" The driving ban helped clear the smog, because it reduced car emissions. Paris has more smog than many other European capitals, which is why reducing how much citizens drive their cars is a good idea.

Some cities have days that are completely car free. Bogota, Colombia is one of them. They have been having a Day Without Cars for three straight years. Cars are banned for the day and buses and taxis are the only exception. The city holds about 7 million people, and had a large turnout. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay even said that, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" The Day Without Cars has even helped stores and sports center come up throughout the city. Instead of shopping centers along a highway, those stores are now in the city and easy to get to without having to use a car.

Researchers have been studying America's ways of car usage and driving. America is home to the first cars like the Model T, or ""Mustang Sally."" Vehichles have always been a huge part of culture, but it seems now that that might not be the case anymore. ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" Researchers are actually hoping that the pattern continues because it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions on the environment. Transportation is the second largest source, behind power plants, of emissions. Many changes have now happened in America, which are making using cars not as important. ""With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.."" The article says. If we could slow down the usage of cars and emission, maybe we could help the planet become a better place.

Since the percentage of car usage has gone down in America, so has the percentage of getting a license. There has been a large drop in 1639 year olds getting a license, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Older people are also likely to retain their licenses as they age. Mr. Sivak and another man both have children of about the same age, 19 and 21, and live in busy cities where a car could be useful. Neither one of them has their licenses, even though they are interested, but they don't really see the need for one when they can use public transportation or carpool with their friends. The article says that a study last year has also found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Whether or not this changes as these young people grow older, these decreases in driving are proving that cars might just not be as important as they used to be.

Our planet is just continuing to get worse from emissions from cars. Some countries are starting to realize this and are working hard to limit car usage and have citizens rely just on public transportation, walking, or riding a bike. Bill Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" Citizens all over the world can work together to reduce car usage and better improve our planet."
e43869b8,0,"In this generation, our planet is getting filthier and filthier by the day. What many people are too late to realize is that we are the main cause of our dirty planet. Cars contribute to air pollution a lot. What's the only solution to this smog filled atmosphere? There are many, but limiting car usage will definitely be beneficial and highly advantageous. Limiting car usage will help reduce air pollution significantly, and will even help humans out too.

We breathe the air in our atmosphere. When you notice that our atmosphere is as dirty as it is, you really don't want to think about what you are putting into your lungs. The amount of air pollution is an extreme amount, and if not controlled soon, we will be in danger. An advantage of limiting car usage would be that the air pollution will be benefitted, and will be getting lower hopefully. As Robert Duffer states Paris of having "" intensifying smog."" That should be very concerning news and should be a clear wake up call. Limiting car usage is definitely something our planet needs to look into. A healthier atmosphere is better than one filled with smog. The decrease of air pollution is just one of the many advantages of limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage is also advantageous by taking away stress. Many people that drive all know what the pains are of being stuck in traffic. What if you don't wake up on time and you skip taking a shower, or skip eating breakfast, and speed as fast as you can to make it to work? It causes severe stress. From that point on in the day, you literally can't concentrate or focus and you just know it is going to be a rough day. Well, limiting car usage would take some stress away. See, super slow traffic , being late to work, skipping the most important meal of the day, it all just builds up into a lot of unneeded and unwanted stress. If people don't have to deal with congested highways, they could enjoy a nice walk to their job, or ride their bicycle. Doing this would instantly take away stress. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" says Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business manSelsky. There are cities that have tried having a day with no cars. It has worked in taking away stress, as you can see. Taking a bike ride or walking instead of driving a car is also beneficial because it's exercise.

Limting car use has its benefits. People should be aware of the growing danger of air pollution, and limitng car usage will help reduce the amount of pollution. Also, it helps in taking away stress and clearing minds. It is not a bad idea to start limiting our car usage, for we will receive the benefits of decreased car usage."
d33eca96,0,"Cars are a basic need for people today we use them to go from point A to point B in the fastest way posible. But one must ask themselves ""do i really need the car?"", ""would i be better off without one?"", how do you tell people that what they have depended on for movement could be hurting them. I believe that cars should have a limited usage in cities because cars affect our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas, they cause smog to form around cities, and cause us to move through life at the fastest pace posible. A limited car usage would change the way we see the world its beauty, its adventersm, and we would be able to save the world from our destruction.

There is a community in Germany called Vauban where people have given up their cars. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars, 57% sold their cars just to move to Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" media trainer and mother of two Heidrun Walter says in the artical ""In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"". Also the artical states that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and responsible for up to 50% in the United States. Vauban houses up to 5,500 resident within a rectangular square mile, which makes it posibly the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life, stores are placed just a short walk away so that no car is needed.

Smog a thick layer of black fog that hurts your lungs and can even kill you. Paris had to ban driving due to smog , cars with even numbered license plates would not be allowed to drive one day and the following day cars with odd numbered license plates would not be allowed to drive. 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters and 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction to the fine. This statement from the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" show that cars are responsible for a gas that can kill people, and that people dont respond well to being told what to do. In one week the ban was lifted because the smog had cleared enough but not all the way, just a week of limited car usage cleared the skys imagin what a year of it would do.

Cars have us going the fastest we can and people have started to live that way through life. In Bogota they have a day free of cars every years like its a holiday. People left their keys on the counter and insted hiked, biked, skated and took the bus. Even in the rain people didnt use their cars, "" The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" says Bogata Mayor Antanas Mockus. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". The quotes from the artical "" Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" show that with out cars people feel realeved of stress and are able to have a good time.

In conclusion limited car usage would help us presurve the world and create a enviroment that could help people aswell. Cars are one of the most used products in the world people might not want to give up their cars but eventually might have to. Smog and greenhouse gas are caused by car overuseage and hurt the enviroment and people. Limited car usage is posably the only answer to helping the world live longer aside from buying a hybrid car."
71f7131e,1,"Why do we keep this despised method of choosing the president when 60% of American citizens want a popular vote instead? This is an outdated method and viewed as anachronism by many. While some say that it creates a more stable outcome, it is a ""winnertakeall"" system where not everyones votes count. The election of the president should be based on popular vote because it is unfair that not everyones votes count, their is a chance of a tie breaking out, and the disaster factor because so much could go wrong. Although it seemed like a good idea at the time, it is unfair and irrational to all voters in the United States.

It is injustice that not everyones votes count under the Electoral College. The process of the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president, and the counting of votes by congress. Voters are directly related to this because the popular vote of a state usually gets the electoral vote of the state. This is good for the majority but what about the minority. The Electoral College is a winnertakeall system so their voice does not get heard. If a voter is democratic in Texas it would be a waste of time voting, because most of texas is republican and the 38 votes would go twords a republican. If it was based on popular voting then the minority would get a say and could help.

One of the most worrying situations is the prospect of a tie in electoral votes. Because the Electoral College is made up of an even 538 electors, Their is the possibility of a tie. If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown into the House of representatives, where state delegations would vote on the president. This would be a problem because some states, such as Wyoming, would only get one or two votes but others, like California, would get more than thirty. Also, the House of representatives would vote for the candidate they want, not reflecting the will of the people at all. If a tie seems unrealistic, just remember in 1968, 41,971 votes would have created a complicated mess.

Moreover, their is the disaster factor, Their are many problems and kinks in the system and some of these can destroy the system. The worst one we ever experienced is the recounts in Florida in 2000. The state legislature could always pick electors that will defy the people. In 1960, the Louisiana state legislature almost changed Democratice electors with ones that would vote againts John F. Kennedy. Also in 1960, Hawaii sent two states of electors to congress. Perhaps the worst is a party's candidate casting a vote for whomever they please, ignoring the people. This is one of the biggest downsides of the Electorial College.

The Electorial college is no longer usefull or democratic. If instead we vote the president on popular vote we won't expirience the unfairness to voters, the problems of a tie, or the disaster factor. It can help in some situations but for the most part is spurious at best. The Electorial College is outdated, unfair, and non democratic and should be replaced by a popular vote."
c3014be8,1,"Dear Senator, The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The system has been around for millenniums from our founding fathers and the Constitution in the 1700s to present day America, it is critical that we update our system to a more realistic process where the citizens have more say in the leader we choose to lead us. I am in favor in abolishing the Electoral College because most of the power should be held in the hand of the citizens and the popular vote should have more regards than the vote in Congress. I am not in favor in keeping the Electoral College because under the college system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate elector, who in turn ""elect the president"", the process is unfair to voters, and over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election rather than the kind we have now.

When people go out of thier way to vote, they vote because they want to have a say in their potentially future. They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actually want to be president. Under the Electoral College voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. In reality the people are not voting for the president they are putting their trust in somebody they vote to vote for the person they have choose to lead. Democrats in Texas for example knowing their vote will have no effect in the election they become less interested in the campaign than they would if the president was choosen directly by popular votes and that is unfair to the people.

The process is unfair to the people because of the ""winner takes all"" system in each state the candidates dont take time in states in which they know have no chances of gaining them any power, they stay in states that are more genetically to them. The candidates mostly focus on the tight races curing in the ""swing states"" in 2000 many states didnt even get to see the candidates because they were ""little, irrelevant, and worthless"" states. I'm sure many people in those states such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campaign but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger states. This is very unfair and judgemental to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North carolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution. They may want to have a say in the election but cant because of their living arrangements.

Many might contradict that the Electoral College is benefical because it has more of a certain outcome but with that certainty comes many votes and state votes that were disregarded. The Electoral College is unfair in many different aspects we need to update our system of election, because like everything else in the world has an expiration date. Their is an expiration date on almost all of our food and beverages, an expiration date on salvery, an expiration date on our life, and so now we need an expiration date on the Electoral College."
0d208d83,1,"Dear State Senator, I am agreeing in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There is no need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. That is because the House of representatives helps elect for us, it helps us to balance our votes, and avoid problems of election. The electoral college helps the people out alot with the voting situation and helps us to better understand and know our new president.

The broader significance of the electoral College is that the House of Representatives helps us vote for our new president. In source One paragraph three it says ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equal the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each number in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators....""That tells me that we the people are not alone in this process of voting who will be our next president. Also in the same source but paragraph five it states ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" This informs me that not only the House of representatives is involved in the elections. Tthe government is important to the electoral College because the votes of the government count most to the College.

It is evident that the Electoral College helps us to balance our votes. As stated in Source Three ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" This lets me know that we as the people won't have to worry to much about the voting and selection of the president. Another piece of evidence stated in the same source and paragraph ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" That states that not all people and states have to worry about who the president will be. The Electoral College hepls us out alot mostly to the big states in the United States.

Above all the Electoral College avoid problems of the elections. In source Three, paragraph Twentytwo it states ""The Electoral College avoids problems of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" This lets us know that the Electoral College is doing a good job on keeping the votes clean and simple to understand. Also stated in the same source and paragraph ""There is no pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential electionn process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which ivariably producess a clear winner..."" That tells me that the Electoral College is keeping the votes on point.

There are some people out there who don't agree with the Electoral College and dont like the way the votes are being put in because sometimes the president that they chose wasn't elected. They are wrong to disagree with the Electoral College because the College keeps everything going in order and in a clear path to let us know who our president will be. As stated in Source Two paragraph Ten ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in tur elect the president. This makes them disagree because they think that the Electoral College doesn't vote for their president, but they souldn't worry because they way they vote is by how many states helped the electors to vote for that presient being chosen as the president. Also In Source Two ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That makes some people diagree also, but the Electoral College doesn't count how many people in each big or small state voted for president. All the college does is help the governmtent elect for the president that they most support and elect for.

I agree that the Electoral College should be kept in favor because of all the help that it gives us and the government. Also the College helps us stay balanced on the votes so that nothing gets missplaced or missunderstood. Most of all it avoids problems during the election so that the people and the government are satisfied with their votes. The Eletroal College is a great way to keep things going at a clear election of the year. The Electoral College doesn't need any changes for me because even if they chose on the elections of the government the votes of the people still count to them as well. The votes of the peopel are important to the Electoral College just as much as the government's votes are."
88220e4d,0,"Many cities and countries are starting a new trend that is not using cars at all. Vehicles can cause many problems such as air pollution, congested roads, and injuries due to wrecks. Some cities have started some type of way to promote how bad vehicles really are and advising people on what to do to stop driving.

For three years in Bogota, columbia, the city has a day called, ""Day Without Cars"" where in this city, home of seven million citizens, nobody can use a vehicle unless they are willing to pay a 25 fee if they were get caught. Columbians greatly support this cause by hiking, biking, skating, and taking the bus to work. This caused the roads to be clear and not congested like they usually are.

Paris has a system to help support limiting car use as well. They take even and odd numbered license plates and designate a day that's either even or odd. On the even day, car owners that have an even license plate are ordered to leave their car at home, and vice versa for odd. If they have drive their car on the day they were ordered to leave it home, they have to pay a fee of 31.

The United States has reached a point to where cars are starting to become unpopular. In 2005, the amount of miles driven peaked, and in April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was down approximately 9% below the peak in 2005. That is equal to where the U.S. was in 1995.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that some companies that are in the computercell phone business are making more money. In the United States, many people are using the computer and telephone to communicate with people because it's faster and easier to access than having to drive around town to meet with someone. This means that computer websites are making more money and the phone companies are making more money since people are using their phones more often.

Next, cars can cause major stress to some people. Traffic jams, animals running across the road, not being able to see due to smog, and car accidents stress people out because they are either too busy to deal with it or being scared that they might hurt someonesomething or may even get hurt themselves. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter in an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Also people's health could improve tremendously as a result of limiting car usage. Walking to work could burn the calories that people ate at breakfast. Hiking, running, skating, and biking to meet up for lunch or for little kids to go to the play ground could greatly increase people's health. Since people would be technically exercising while going to places, they would be more proned to drinking water to rehydrate themselves which would make them a healthier person in the process as well.

The process of limiting car usage has started or has already taken over cities and countries. It can reduce stress, increase the health of people, and increase the profit for business. The advantages of limiting car usage may seem small, but in the end they will have a huge impact on societies."
5ea9e48f,1,"Dear Senator, We should abolish the electoral college. It makes voting unfair and is dangerous to the American society. It corrupts the soul of all Americans and makes people unhappy. If we want our society to live, we should end the electoral college.

The electoral college is extremely biased on the candidates and the voters have only a miniscule chance to elect the right voter. The chance is so miniscule that even an atom couldn't fit through it. On the counterclaim that it could be a tie, which has a higher percentage rate to tie, all of America, or 0.00000001% of the population of America? The candidates dont even focus on the states that aren't swing states, such as Wyoming or Alaska. If a president is from California, heshe already has 20% of the vote in hisher pocket. To make things worse, half of the states are not even into the campaign, voting candidates ""they"" think is best, not voting the candidates their state thinks is best.

To top it off, people are just so wooed by the candidate's ad, or their wealth, or their eyes, that they don't stop to think what the canditate could do for them. Just two years ago, I found myself talking to a women who needed Obamacare for her ill son, yet she was going to vote for Romney. People are just too dazzled by how things may seem, when it's just a huge marketing scam.

A large state gets more attention than a smaller state does... Is that what we really want in our country? After all these years of black equality and women's rights, we have decided to just completely ruin our entire form of government by being prejuice to other states. Yes, they may have a lesser population, but that doesn't mean anything. It just means that we are not giving people the right of suffrage.

Apparently, the electoral college elects a ""clear winner"", when the popular vote coiuld do that just fine on its own. Why do you think we have voting day for? I'm sure its so that the president that they didn't vote for was chosen by the elctoral college. Here's some logic, lets choose a selected number of people to vote for president instead of all of America. Isn't that a great idea.

""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" Really, is that why people vote? So you are saying that people vote just because they prefer, or like, the person other another candidate. So going back to my earlier point, people are just so amazed at their ""something"", that they just decide to take the effort to vote for them. No, people, that's not why, it's because they think they can make a change in the everyday world.

Ladies and gentlemen, it's all a game of cruel manipulation, Republicans manipulating the government so they get less taxes, Democrats manipulating the government to achieve free healthcare. It's a dangerous game, but the puppeteer who pulls the strings better than the last is the one who always wins."
0d9b0568,0,"Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save money. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minimize pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.

In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park"" Rosenthal 2 but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. ""Carowners can buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Rosenthal 2 That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars "" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of vaughn's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.

Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a ""partial driving ban to clear the air or global city"" Duffer 10. For example, in this article called "" "" by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be 31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about ""4,000 drivers were fined,"" and ""27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" Duffer 12. Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" Duffer 14. The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.

Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.

For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of ""7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines."" Selsky 21 Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has ""118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City."" Selsky 27 One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.

Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called "" "", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Rosenthal 29 The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, ""Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" Rosenthal 29. New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.

To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air unless it's a hybrid. The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages."
5a29f673,1,"Even though you may believe that keeping the electoral college is a great idea and a benefit to all, its not. Americans votes no longer count when having the electoral college and do not care for our opinion on whom we believe should become our president, they decide in what they think is best for us. ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". Plumer, paragraph 14. Most americns believe that the electoral college is unfair and voting has become a waste of their time and that there is no need to vote if their votes no longer count.

Our votes do not count and we are no longer in control. ""Most states have a winner take all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" The Office Of The Florida Register, paragraph 7 Therefore no matter who wants what if that is what the electoral college decides thats what goes, And many americans are getting tired of doing pointless voting if it doesnt even matter. ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Plumer, paragraph 12 Yes, The electoral college might be voting for what they think is best for us, but whats best for us might not be want we want, it might not be what we think is best for us why does are vote no longer count? ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed... however, is is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" Posner, paragraph 16 Our votes are just a back up plan and we are not important. ""The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" Posner, paragraph 22 If the electoral college leads to a tie our votes become the tie braker but that method has never been use so why are we even voting? "" It is the electors whyo elect the president, not the people."" Posner, paragraph 15 Because the electoral college is voting for which ""package"" they think is best they believe that our opinions are unimportant and they know what is best beyond what we believe. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of elecetors, who in turn elect the president."" Plumer, paragrph10 Our votes are just a second optiion and is not resonible and fair to each and every american who truly believe that they can make a diffrenece when they truly cant because they are an ""extra."" All in all the electoral college should not be kept. Most americans now believe that we are not important and voting is just a waste of time which is currently true and fighting againt the truth is not going anywhere. Loose electoral college or loose active americans."
6b1801f6,1,"I think that we should change from the Electoral College, to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Yes, the electoral College in good in some ways, but I believe the flaws it has out numbers the good things. When you vote you really aren't voting for the president but for a slate of electors, there was the 2000 fiasco, and there really isn't that many reasons to keep the current method of choosing our president.

According to the article ""What is Electoral College?"" The electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress. So you really are'nt voting for the president but for a slate of electors. electors can be anyone isn't holding a public office. Who is picked as the electors depends on the state. Sometimes there's state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't control who the electors vote for and sometimes voters get confused about electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

There was also the 2000 fiasco that was the biggest election crisis in a century, and the system allows for much worse, according to ""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong."" There have been a few occasions where ""faithless"" electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and casted the deciding vote for whomever they pleased. Oh, and what happens if a state sends two state electors to Congress? According to ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" it happened it hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richar Nixon, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent."" But who's to say it won't happen again?

The Electoral College does have some goods things about it as well. It states those things in the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" 1. There is always a Certainty of Outcome ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. 2. It makes it Everyone's President.""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" Which means no regions has enogh elecotrol votes to elect a president. 3. Swing states, ""the winnertakeall method of awarding elecotral votes includes the candidates to focus their campaigns efforts on the tossup states."" 4. Big States, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the senate decreed in the Constitution"" 5. It avoids runoff Elections, ""Electoral College avoids the problem of electionsin which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" Now, you can see why I think we should change from the College Electoral to election by Popular Vote. The Electoral Vote does have it's advantages but I think the many disadvantages that come with it outweigh those advantages.

When you vote you really aren't voting for the president but for a slate of electors, there was the 2000 fiasco, and there really isn't that many reasons to keep the current method of choosing our president."
a23c6a2c,0,"Cars are creating an harmful environment with problems such as smog and traffic. Reduction on car usage can help these problems. Although cars may be a faster transportation, they add on to the havoc of the environment. Reducing car usage has many advantages. It would help develop a better environment and improve people's well being.

An advantage of reduction of car usage is it helps develop a better environment to live in. Some areas which have cars create a lot of smog which is unhealthy for the environment. For example, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog"" Duffer. Smog is formed by cold nights and warm days which causes the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Without so many cars, this issue can decrease. It will help the environment progress and be safer for everyone. Statistics show that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Rosenthal. Cars are causing air pollution. If cars are still the dominant transportation, the environment will still suffer from air pollution such as smog. It's safer to use a large vehicle such as a bus to get around because a bus can hold many more people than a car and would ultimately give off less gas than the population of people who use cars. Another safe way around town would be vehicles which don't give off gases into the air such as bicycles. A safer environment is a better environment.

Another advantage of reduction of cars is improvement of people's well being. With air pollution from cars, humans inhale toxic gases which can be detrimental to their bodies. If car usage plunders, people's bodies will feel better. A businessman said ""It's good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Plaza. Lowering the number of cars being used helps relieve stress. Nobody wants to be stressed out from traffic or being late to work. With cars there is always a place where there is traffic. Ultimately, reduction of car usage has numerous effects that benefit the society. A media trainer and mother of two stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Walter. Without a car, you don't have to worry about being severely injured since most of the population would transfer to the use of bikes or walking. Because the population would start a trend of riding bikes and walking, most of the roadways would now be unecessary to have and they could be built into something fundamental such as a park, a housing area, or a food market. There would be less worries altogether and this could be more beneficial to the society.

There are many positive effects from reducing car usage. Environment will progress and people's well being will improve. It's beneficial for everyone to limit the use of cars and find other transportation. There would be a safer environment from less smog and rushhour restrictions. Also, the environment will be peoplefriendly from more parks and sports centers. Limiting car usage effects society positively."
6b2e1c08,1,"Dear Senator, I'd like to take some of your time to shed some light on the matter of having popular vote for the president of the United states.""We the people "" ,That stands strong in our society and I'd like it to stay that way.Majority of the people,Thats what its about.Over 60% have voted to have popular vote to elect our president.Thats over half,and numbers speak.Yes,The electoral college has its good but over all bad,There is so much trust put into each states electors and some voters dont even know it.

The number one fault in the electoral college is the electors themself.Most voters get confused and have no idea how the electoral college works,better yet that we vote for our electors.The electors we do vote for by choosing the candidate by popular vote,sometimes dont vote for their party.The majority of the states residents ,That means who the people wanted they arent even promised the vote for.

I understand the good in the electoral college though.It helps keep states from tieing ,and causing chaos.But,We the people do not have our justice in that manner.If the winning vote is casted by state the legislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors in favor of the vote.Then when it comes time to fairly make their votes for us,the people who voted ,They can change their minds if they like an vote for the least liked candidate running for office by Florida is they wanted too! Thats ridiculous and has no justice.The winner takes all system is very faulty and unfair.

I'm sorry if I have wasted any of your time but I felt this matter is important to the USA.""We the people"",Anyone past middle school can tell you where the beginning of that sentence came from.If we want to keep America fair and keep our pride in our country we should most defiantly start electing our presidents by popular vote,instead of relying on an out dated system that has many faults and injustice as I have pointed out.Thank you for your time."
a96f1054,1,"The United States has ways of being civilized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. The U.S should stick with the Electoral College because its a game changer and trust worthy.

To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day. In the article "" In defense of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney"". In this piece of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. Now in the article ""the indefensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states "" because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. But even thought bradford disagrees with the method, bradford still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. Basically the Electoral College is just a big game changer on Election Day.

Futhermore the Electoral College is just a trust worthy method to use. Also it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is because each state has an Electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. So the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.

All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties."
cbc48dd7,0,"Zroom! Cars have been developing for hundreds of years all over the world. They have become very dangerous to the environment and there are many advantages to limiting the use of them.

There is only so much space on earth and lot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles but they also take up valuable space! By limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.

Another important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Everyday we hear about a new car that just came on the market but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embaresseed to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost everyday as the price keeps rising.

Finally, car usage is extremely bad for the environment. Paris is in days of nearrecord pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After awhile it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.

In conclusion, we should all limit the use of cars. Although its ok to use them in moderation they are still space consuming, expensive, and bad for the environment."
2f77a63b,0,"In the newer ages, people were worried about how they would get from A to B. They would have the curiosity of what others were driving, as of Mr. Sav ik in the article The End of Car Culture said when he was around twenty years of age. Most relied on cars because it was quicker or easier to have their own. They always thought about the disadvantages of not having a car but not the advantages. Helping the environment, saving money, and safety of others are all advantages of limiting car usage which citizens fail to realize.

To start off, limiting car usage helps the environment and helps keep it clean. In Europe passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Experts say that the the main cause of the greenhouse not being able to reduce gas emmisons is because of the tailpipe of cars driven around.

For example, Beijing,China is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris,France even banned cars for five days because the air pollution was so thick. They fined people for thirtyone dollars if they refused to leave their vehicle at home. Everyone wants to live as long as they can and to have a clean environment,so why not give up your car for a few days to help contribute.

Furthermore, everyone ould love to have a little more money in their pockets instead of putting it in their gas tank. Limiting car usage is the way to go if you want to save money. In Vauban,Germany you are allowed to have a car but it would cost you an arm and a leg just to have one. For car ownership there, you would have to buy a parking space for forty thousand dollars and a home.

As a result to having to pay that ridiculous amount of money for one parking space seventy percent of Vauban families do not own cars at all. Over fifty percent of the citizens sold their car before they moved there. Having that extra amount of money helps a lot.

Therefore, the safety for others is also an advantage of limiting car usage. If most of all the people are either walking or biking their way to their destination, no one would have to worry about getting hit by a car or getting into a car accident.

In German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars , Heidrun Walter explained how when she did have a car she would always tense up while drivng. Now that she doesn't have to worry about driving she is much happier with walking or riding her bike.

In conclusion, Helping the environment, saving money, and safety of others are just some of the advantages of limiting car usage. Their not only advantages but benefits to you as well. As said in the forth article, the percentage of people getting their licenses has dropped. The miles of driven by one person in 2013 was nine percent below the peak in January 1995. Slowly but surly the trend of not using a car is not blooming in the European countries but in the US as well."
a6bb33d4,1,"The people have a right to say what they want to happen in their community, state, and even as far as the country they live in. They should be able to decide whether they want a park built in their city or whether they want a specific up and coming President. Yes, popular vote at the moment seems favorable for the people, but it does not mean that the people don't vote in the the process of the Electoral College. They truly do vote for their president, just not in a way that they would like. Nonetheless, they do. That being said, the system of election should be kept to the Electoral College.

To begin with, the Electoral College, in a sense, is not democratic, as seen in modern times but it does not mean that it is not equal. Yes, they are voting for an elector in their state, trusting that they would vote for their chosen candidate. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...,"" as shown by Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". This means that, even though the people are voting for an elector to pass on their message, they are still voting to make sure that the president they want to take the seat will get it. The electors so rarely betray the trust of the voters it has happened one time in 2000, but again that was the first time since 1888. The most thoughtful voters will listen closely to the campaign, then choose which president they feel is fit. Which again, leads to the voters deciding, in the end. Furthermore, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states making it equal amongst those that have more population. For the most part, the Electoral College is equal.

However, others can argue against the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always,"" said Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong."" That being said, sure they can't control that but the elector rarely betrays the trust of the voters, only happening twice in recorded history. The Electoral College is still less likely to cause a problem than popular vote would. If popular vote were to play in hand as a system of choosing the president, then things outside of even politics such as, riots, would get out of hand. ""...in the Constitution as comprimise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,""as said by the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"" Either way, voters do get popular vote, and vote for their elector to vote for their chosen President. It is a balanced idea of both a government and citizen based vote for the leader of the country.

Overall, the Electoral College by far is a balanced system than popular vote is. It is fair, in the sense, that everybody gets a vote and in total, their votes go to what they think is best for their country. Which in turn, does allow for them to decide."
dbf85434,0,"Travel, exploration, and new destinations are all things that have lead to mankind creating new ways to get from where they were to where they wanted to be. We have made some fantastic technologies in our desire to move more quickly and extensively. Not many could have dreamt of a day when mankind could ship large cargo from Mexico to Greece, fly large planes full of people across the atlantic, or even what seems so common today, drive in comfort from state to state in short amounts of time. We enjoy the ability to drive so easily from place to place that almost every single American family owns at least one car, but there in lies a problem.

since the big boom of industrial car manufacturing in the early twentieth century America's use of the vehicle has spread from transportation of the high class, to a tool of public transportation, construction, delivery, and overall everyday use. This relationship between man and machine has been a part of our society for so long it is practically a part of our lives, but this relationship has taken a toll on the world it was brought into in the form of pollution. The basic way an automobile functions is by putting fuel into the system to run the engine and then emmiting that fuel as a gas byproduct, and with such the wide spread use we have of these machines, the amount of gas byproduct has really built up. Harmful chemicals in these gas emissions from our automobiles have provided the second largest source of our emissions with only power plants contributing more to the pollution of the environment.

There are however some easy ways we could help fix this problem. In other parts of the world this effect is being felt, such as Beijing, China, which is facing a huge problem with pollution smog, and certian places have decided to make a change by limiting car use. This limitation of car use can be done in many different ways, and has helped curb a smog problem that arose in Paris. Other places have done this by means of carfree neighborhoods in Germany, or a carfree day in Columbia, and the reaction has been most positive.

These ideas of change for a clean future are helping communities in different parts of the world, so whose to say we can't do it too? We should contribute to the healing of our environment before its too late for the choise. This oppurtunity for change is not one we should let slip by, and it could be a refreshing, enjoyable change. Lets not sit down and watch as our environment becomes a smogridden disaster, lets get up, walk around, and help heal the world."
3cd66fb5,0,"Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advantages such as reducing pollution, increasing safety for human beings, and even opening options for alternative transportion.

Cars release a great amount of pollutants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with hepburn Walter. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vehicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay 40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined 31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public announcement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleaner. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.

Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familiar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vehicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases safety, bumping into another human or being nudged by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportuinity to take away stress..."" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.

Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering."
5f019f6d,1,"Dear senator, My associates and I, have thought long and hard that we should have the Electoral College removed. Why? The Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and boring. We feel as if we should spice things up and be able to decide and presidents wit a majority vote rule. I know what your saying, "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" With that I want to include that, if a state were to have it's own vote within the state and turn that into a vote then use that as a majority rule everything would be much easier. For Instance, in florida if lets say 72% vote President Obama, then that would be a vote for obama from florida and with the other 49 states doing the same thing then we have a easy way of using the majority rule.

Bob Dole was right we should abolish the electoral college. Why should we vote for someone who half the time picks the president you dont want. There are many reasons why we should ban the electoral college we dont necessarily have use the majority rules method, but any other idea besides the electoral college i would go with any day. Why? Would you want to keep the electoral college? Why? Do you think this is helping america, its not really doing us harm, but why?

I see you might argue that the electoral college is widely regarded an an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of deciding on a president. Is needs to be overruled by another method or even the majority rule. Considering you tried to i assume balance powers by making us vote for electors, who actually they get to vote for the president. You also might say their are five reasons you might want to keep the electoral college. The certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, avoid runoff elections.

And with all that said. I want just want you to think of other possibilities to use to replace Electoral College. I assure you that if the it is removed and you use the majority rule something similar you can decide a president much faster."
df50e792,1,"Dear Senator of Florida, Being a man of your caliber and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today because I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to today economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of ""If it aint broke dont fix it."" Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.

Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.

Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popular votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number538. Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.

In closing, I just wanted to express my thoughts about the electoral vote process with you today. I believe its very unfair, outdated, and irrational. With all the infractions that can occur and risks that are involved, I believe it needs to be changed. And I believe now is time for that change! Thank you."
43371786,0,"In this day and age, car ownership is extremely common among people of all demographics, despite its negative effects on the environment. Cars burn fuels incompletely, releasing harmful byproducts into the atmosphere that can cause thick smog to occur, among other things.Many people have realized the damage caused and have abstained from using personal motor vehicles, or have at least decreased in their use. However, many people still do not know all the advantages that come from living a carfree lifestyle. Living without a car may seem daunting at first due to its reputation as the most popular mode of transportation since its inception. When these preconceived notions are brushed aside, the benefits can shine through. Limiting car usage is not only costeffective, but it also dramatically decreases greenhouse gas emissions, lowers obesity, and allows people to conserve the nonrenewable resources that cars depend on. Cleaner cities lead to less illness and a better quality of life for its citizens.

Limiting car usage can be very costeffective, especially in a place like Vauban, Germany. In this particular town, it costs 40,000 just to park, not including the costs of the actual car, gas, tolls, and repairs that come with being a car owner. It is much more inexpensive to simply walk, bike, or utilize public transportation. People may have to give up a small amount of convenience, but they will surely enjoy the spike in their finances once they become accustomed to life without a car.

Without cars, an opening becomes apparent for cheap transportation. Walking, biking, and skating can replace the need for cars. These methods require people to put in effort to get to their destination. This effort burns calories for energy and allows the user to commute and exercise at the same time, allowing people to lead healthier, more active lifestyles. With the current obesity epidemic occurring in the United States, humanpowered transportation is a viable option that is worth considering for the sake of America's heath. If cars are banned, cities will build more and more bike paths to accommodate the needs of the people just as it has happened in Bogota, Columbia. Reducing obesity would mean reclaiming the millions of dollars lost each year to healthcare costs on obesity related illnesses, such as heart disease. Cutting out cars could be the healthiest choice people ever make.

Greenhouse gases trap heat near Earth's atmosphere and contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss. Car emissions are a large part of the total emissions released, but that has the potential to change. Building cities closer together promotes walking in leiu of driving and reduces the amount of cars on te road, spewing their toxic byproducts. Slowing down climate change should be the most important reason why cities everywhere should take the initiative and eliminate cars.

Any small inconvience caused by not owning a personal vehicle is quickly outweighed by all the benefits the world can reap through getting rid of cars, once and for all. The problems they have inflicted on the world can finally be neutralized."
8414217a,1,"Abolishing the electoral college would be the best way to go for everyone. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. source 2, Plumer Some wonder, are the people in the electoral college even reliable? Many also believe that the electoral college is an unfair way of deciding whom the president will be. The electoral college is also flawed in a way that it makes the smaller states feel less important than the bigger states.

Are the people in the electoral college always reliable? Who even knows who chooses our electoral college? Voting citizens can't even control who the electoral college votes for sometimes, this is unjust and an outrage considering us citizens do the moral duty to vote and may not even get a fair outcome anyways. And, there are some cases in which voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. source 2, Plumer This ""winner takes all"" system is a big mess and highly unnecessary. Not to mention, it is also a very unfair way of deciding.

Some question if the electoral college is a fair way of voting. Which it is not. The electoral college can cause an unfair vote to the presidents which also upsets us citizens. What if say, 5,000 people vote in Florida, 3,000 for president 1, and 2,000 for president 2, and the electoral college sends it off as president 1 gets the vote for that college. But then, that 1,000 vote difference could have changed the vote for president country wide. A scenario like this may be unlikely, but it is possible. It has already happened once, it would be a shame if it did again. Chance of a situation like this draws a lot of people away from voting for president. Another unfair scenario was in 1976 when a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. Source 2, Plumer The electoral collage is bound to cause a catastrophe and we should stop it before it does.

The elctoral college is also unfair in a way that smaller states votes do not feel as important. Some people in the smaller states even say they haven't seen a campaign poster throughout an entire election because candidates feel as if campaigning isn't important in places that only have 3 or 4 electoral colleges. If we had a popular vote society, people in smaller states would feel like their vote is as important as those in the bigger states.

Overall, the electoral college is higly unfair way of deciding anything. It should be abolished before it turns into a problem. Many can agree that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."
28d4b384,1,"Since our beautiful country was born we've always used the Electoral College system to elect our presidents. It's time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote, because it's simply unfair to all the hardworking people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hours to fill out a little white paper. The Electoral does not allow for everyone's voice to be heard. Clearly, the Electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner take all method, & the confusion.

To begin with, the Electoral college is outdated because of the winner take all system. Even if the votes are off by one, whichever partygoers the most popular votes gets all of the electoral votes the United States are basically saying everybody else's voice that voted doesn't matter. This winner takes all system also deals with population, the bigger the state the more electoral votes. This ancient system is clearly stating the citizens of the smaller states votes do not matter. Although, the winner take all method induces the candidates to focus on the toss up states, it's still unfair to everyone.

In addition, the Electoral college is irrational because of all of the confusion and trust issues. Many of the citizens in our country don't even know what an electoral college is! Plus the fact that most people think they're voting for the president, but in reality they're voting for the slate of electors. It's also possible the electors that represent your party votes for the other candidate! Another major reason the Electoral college must be abolished is because the citizens do not even get to choose their very own electors! It's like buying a new car while being blindfolded and believing the dealer the car runs fine. Everyone's going to have skepticism so they should at least let the citizens choose their own electors. Then again, the Electoral college avoids run off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral college was once a good idea for a starting country, but we now live in a elite dynasty that must have a few modifications on how the citizens elect their leader."
e6ab67c2,0,"All over the world, major cities are trying to reduce their use of cars. From Germany, to France, to Columbia, and coming back to the US, people are limiting car use to reduce pollution, or live better, or even to save money. In some places, there is one day every year that doesn't allow cars. In other places, there are whole communities that dont allow cars year round.

In Germany, there is a community in named Vauban that doesnt allow cars unless you have the money to pay for a parking spot that is on the outskirts of town. The revolutionizing community makes peopl pay 40, 000 dollars just for one parking spot. This wonderful new place has reduced the amount of greenhouse gas produced in the last few years drastically, with 70% of the population not owning a car. This has encouraged many other countries to start something just like it.

The city of love may not be so lovely if it's so smoggy you can barely see. Paris was gaining so much air pollution from the amount of gas that was released from driving hta they put a ban on driving. This ban consisted of a few new rules to help prevent the smog from overpowering the beauty of the city. On Mondays, even numbered license plates were not allowed to use their car for anything. This same rule applied to the odd numbered license plates on Tuesdays. This helped limit the amount of driving, in return limiting the amount of smog. Smog is created when the area has cold night weather and warm day weather, causing the air to trap car emission. Diesel can be a big contributor to this and is the main gas type in France. France favors diesel because of their taxing system, but it seems they don't care too much about their environment.

What would happen if every country had a day with no cars? The city of Bogota, Columbia has had a Day without cars once a year for quite a few years. Just recently, other columbian cities have joined in and even Paraguay's capital has participated. What this day is supposed to do is promote the use of other types of transportation, for example walking or biking. It also reduces smog and the amount of air pollution, in retaliation, improving the city. In Bogota, there is a 25 fine for those who do not participate in this environmentally helpful day.

Although the amount of driving in the US has decreased since 2005, there is more we can do to help the situation. The average number of miles driven did peak in 2005 and drop from there, in return, dropping other statistics as well. As of April of 2013, the number of driven miles has dropped 9% below the peak, being the same as in January of 1995, says Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. The roads have even become safer due to the amount of young drivers dropping 23% between the years of 20012009. Even if the number of miles hadn't peaked, there still wouldn't be as many drivers on the road because of the recession. Americans couldn't afford to but cars due to the amount of money lost during that horrible time.

All through the world, people are trying to slowly save their environment by reducung car use. From one day to a whole year, everything helps to save our world. The German community of Vauban has made it nearly impossible to own a car. Paris, at one point, had to put restrictions on their driving. Columbia has an annual day of no cars. The US is working on lowering thier use of cars and dropping their average miles to help clear the air surrounding them. Even if it is walking from point A to point B, it helps the community and lowers air pollution."
bf9968d8,1,"There have been many discussions whether or not having an electorsal college as the system to decide the president is alright. Many people say this system is corrupted and that it must be thrown out to think of a new better government system, while many other people disagree and state that ""yes"", this system works perfectly well and that we should keep it this way for many years. Of course, most of the population of the country simply believe this system is best and we should keep it. This may be because certainty of the outcome, and because the system is made out well. Of course, there is also a downside to this such as when a person goes to vote, their not necessarily voting for whom they believe to be voting for.

To begin with, having the electorsal college is great because of the fact that there is certainty of the outcome. As said in source 3 by Richard A. Posner, there is absolute certainty of the person you're voting for is going to win or lose. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electorsal vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Useing this as an example explains that the electorsal college, to win it, you must need the majority votes.

Furthermore, the system it self is made out really well. As said in source 1, the electorsal college process consists of the selection of the electorss which consists of 538 and only takes 270 electorsal votes to elect a president. During this meeting they vote for who they want as president and vice president. Also, your state's entitled allotment of electorss equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. In a way you could say that, the electorsal college is like a game, and many people just want it gone because they aren't good at it, or just don't understand it.

Of course there is always a downside to everything. This flaw is that, when you're voting, you're not voting for who you believe you are voting for. As said in source 2, when you vote for your president, the vote doesn't go to the president, but for the slate of electorss, who in turn elect the president. This may not sound so bad, but with something such as this, there could easily be some corruption in that and could change the outcome of the election. But even with this said, it's an unlikable chance. when you vote, the electors you voted for is most likely going to be an electors which will vote for your president. So no worries.

In conclusion, letting the electorsal college stay is a good idea. It is a well thought out system, and the certainty of which president will be elected is completely accurate which doesnt make it a big guessing game. Don't pay attention to those conspiricies of the electorsal college, that we have a great system."
78bc587a,0,"Nowadays, there is one sure thing we depend on to go from Point A to Point B: cars. Cars are used everywhere to drive to work, school, a park or wherever it may be. However, the total amount of automobiles moving out in the streets consumes up too much gas. This gas being released causes smog, or air pollution, that is harmful to our atmosphere & is one of the main causes of global warming. Next, the elimination of cars improves the safety of pedestrians and people wandering on the roads which has indeed prevented people from dying in countries like Colombia and France.

To begin with, when people are driving cars for whatever it may be, they are unintentionally harming the economy. This happens because cars run off of gasoline and when a car is accelerating, the gas is being burned by the motor engine which after is released into the air. Smog is produced being one of the top causes for global warming & this is an exceedingly problematic effect to the atmospherical being of humans and space. Moreover, Paris has reinforced a temporary driving ban due to these longterm, harmful effects to clear the air of the global city. If drivers refuse to obey, they would get fined 22 euros and up to 4,000 drivers were fined. They were blaming diesel fuel although, after five days of intensifying smog, congestion drastically dropped 60% competing against Beijing, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In addition, the elimination of cars in the streets has benefited society in a way that it keeps people safe. As various countries around the world face the risk of car accidents, innocent deaths, lack of resources, and car commuting, they begin to enact laws to try & stop these risky, dangerous downfall from happening. In the suburbs located within Germany, residents of Vauban are pioneers doing what commuting executives have never done before: giving up their cars. This happens since street parking and driveways aren't allowed although the streets are ""carfree"", a couple are found at the edge of a community as well as the tram running down Freiburg. Plus, without an abundant amount of automobiles anymore, cities become more loose and flow therefore providing a better walking path.

To conclude, cars on the streets may be efficient for people to get to places easily and rapidly, but the substances it releases is harmful to the environment. Smog and air pollution are formed when cars drive greatly contributing to global warming, because they consume up too much gas. Furthermore, not only does it cause air pollution, but it also creates a possibility of putting people's lives in danger by the factors that might affect the consciousness of a driver. So the eliminating of cars does the community good both physically and economically like it is practiced in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota."
6b3d3d11,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage would be less pollution, less traffic, and less money involved. For example, in the German suburbs, large garages that are at the end of development where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home. So cut down cost on that Germany people have given up their cars.

Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. That doesn't mean that car ownership is not aloud but there is only two places to park, large garages and homes. This cuts down on money costs for Germany by a long shot because with no cars then people don't have to spend money on gas, and Germany's streets will be safe without the cars messing up the roads and less car accidents will occur. Although critics may say that it will be difficult for people to get around, it stands that people are just happier this way. For example, Heidrum Walter is a media trainer and a mother of two says, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, after days of nearrecord pollution. Motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. Same for the oddnumbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. Which is an effective way to lessen pollution in Paris since it is so polluted in the first place. They also said it was easier to imagine than a carfree ChampsElysees. Doing this got them great results as well, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog, which is rivaled by Beijing, China for being known as one fo the most polluted cities in the world. The smog was cleared enough on Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday.

In Bogota, Colombia millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day. Which left the Colombian streets devoid of traffic jams. Traffic jams are pretty annoying and no one wants to go through them so making up a day like this is extremely good for the environment and for your phyci as well. If people would violate this day they would get charged 25 fines. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" so doing this day it would make people more relaxed and happy but also be good to the enviroment just like in Germany.

In the end of the day, it is important to know that all of these things these countries are doing are for the good of the world. It is good that it is more of a mandatory participation then a optional objective so that people won't take global warming seriously even though it is."
30873a5a,1,"When you go to vote for the president are you actually voting for the president? With the Electoral Collage system your not realy voting for the candidate directly, your just voting for someone else to vote for you. Is that realy how voting should work? What if the candidate with less votes wins and is a terrible president.

Say you vote for an elector and he loses, then what is the point in your vote. Everyones vote should count right? But with the electoral college system not everyones vote counts towards the presidential election. What about those few republican voters in a population that is mostly democratic. Thats why the Electoral college system should not be used anymore. In the 2000 election Al Gore actually had more votes than George W Bush, but because of the Electoral college system George W Bush was elected because he had more electoral votes than Gore. The Article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses or the system are wrong"" by bradford Plumer states ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". What about all those other voters whos electors didn't win, shouldn't they have a say in who our leader should be?

The only person you would trust with everything on the line is yourself right? So why would you want to trust someone who you have never ment with something as important a your vote. If you asked 100 people if you could vote for them if they just told you who they wanted to vote for, most likley 99 or all of those people would say no. But they are realy just going to vote for someone who will vote for them. The article ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner states "" it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely"". Can we realy trust ""rarley"" for when we are deciding on the future of our country! We must be certin that the right person is chosen for the job. It docent matter if your female, male, white, black, hispanic, human, or not human, if your the more popular vote you should be elected.

What if the wrong person gets voted in office. What if the person with the majority of the votes still docent get elected to office and it turns out to be disaterous for our nation. When your electing the president your electing the person who is going to lead our nation for four years! The person who gets elected needs to be favored by everyone. Lets say that the electoral college never exsited and Al gore gets elected in 2000, our country could be in a much better state then it is now. We wouldn't be in as much debt, and mabey we wouldnt be fighting a war in afganistan, but we would never know because the electoral college voted the less popular candidate in office. The article ""What Is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register states "" Most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". But shouldnt the winner take all for the majority votes of the whole country? There is alot of lost votes because of the electoral college system.

There are endless arguments for both sides. But with a decision as big ass who should be the leader of our country, we cant trust any system that has even the slightest chance of failing. The wrong candidate can get elected at any given election with the electoral college system. That could lead to disaster or even worse."
6cff7fd5,0,"Many European countries have been making a move towards limiting car usage in efforts of halting pollution, adding exercise to everyday life, conserve resources, and improve safety for others. An example of this phenomenon is Vauban, Germany, where suburbs are not allowed to drive vehicles. Doing this has helped improve society by bringing people closer to each other and removing the stress of traffic. Other people create a holiday for this, Carfree day, where people can only get around by public transportation and walking. As countries become more organized, there is a lesser need for cars to get around as the city is closing in on us.

Various countries have been making cities more dense and bring stores and businesses closer to neighborhoods, with the idea of Smart Planning. This idea is making communities more compact, like vaughn's 5,500 residents living within a square mile. With this, the need of cars is drastically reduced, creating a stress free environment that is less polluted and clean. Also, to discourage the use of cars, there are only parking garages on the edge of town and barely any parking spots, leaving more room for sidewalks and housing development. People began to walk socialize along the way, allowing exercise and social benefits.

Car pollution has been a major problem ever since the first cars were made. In the Paris, the smog became so thick, they had to partially ban driving. Even license plates one day, the next odd license plates. Congestion was down 60% after 5 days of intense smog. This pollution was due to the French government subsidizing and favoring Diesel fuels. In this time, all public transit were free of charge and people walked to get to where they needed to be. However, delivery companies lost revenue, but exceptions such as plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more people.

In America, the recession has had a devastating effect on some people, many couldn't afford to drive due to gas prices, and sold their cars. ""A study last year has found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009"". This means that Public Transportation, carpooling, and pedestrian are becoming a more commonly used way of getting from A to B, and are more affordable.

Companies like Ford got together at the Mobile World Congress and laid out a business plan for a world in which vehicle ownership is impractical and undesirable. Their chairman, Bill Ford, proposed partnerships with telecommunication companies. They want to make cities that are more based on pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportion. Doing this, they think it will save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.

The world changes slowly, and these ideas might never catch on. Today, there is a lesser need of cars as cities become more organized and as we start facing an environmental problem. Better city layouts are being made to reduce the need for vehicles by bring businesses closer to neighborhoods. People are sponsoring no car days, smog reduces, and people find that they don't need cars to get around."
553fd04a,1,"Electoral college... what a compromise! the electoral college should be removed and replaced by the popular vote for the president because our votes don't really count and the electors are not always fair.

In the passage it had said ""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for the president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate electors."" This means our votes are not really counting. The state electors are the ones who are actually selecting the president for us. Candidates don't spend time in states that they have no chance of winning. Putting the fate of presidency in the hands of a few swing votes is ridiculous. The electoral college is irrational and doesn't show much of reality. Some people tend to lose interest in the president's because of the way they feel about their votes. Thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election and vote directly instead for representatives to do so. People have refused to vote for party candidates and wan't to cast a vote for whomever they please. There are over sixty percent of people that would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Another reason why electoral college should get replaced is because it is not fair sometimes. ""can voters control whom their electors vote for? not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? sometimes."" This is the disaster factor, it is hardly expected to reflect on the will of the people. A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states do. At times a presidents can have more popular votes and the other less fewer electoral votes and the one with the popular votes lose and that only happened once. In run off elections if people know that their vote will not have an effect and think its unfair than they have less incentive to pay attention to any campaign than they would if the president were picked by popular votes. Potential voters will turn off the electoral method if they know a candidate has not hope of building up their state.

That is why electoral votes should be replaced with popular votes for the president because most of the time our votes do not count and it is unfair to us."
82ed3eab,0,"Cars are an integral part of many peoples lives around the world: they provede transportation to work and home, they cater to social lives, and for some they even provede a home.

However, it's becoming a trend to limit car usage, particularly in Europe. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up cars almost completely, with the exception of a 40,000 parking garage fee that over half of the residents have elected not to use.

While it may make getting places harder, the effects of cutting down on car usage are mostly good ones.

First and foremost on this list is global warming. In Europe, cars produce around twelve percent of greenhouse emissions, while in the US, the number can be as high as fifty percent in cities. This is not good. Global warming is destroying the ice caps and the ozone layer of Earth, leading to a temperature increase that is damaging many environments around the world. This, in addition to pollution released by cars and the oil industry, could permanently cripple our planet. Any way that we can cut the effects of global warming should be implemented.

Secondly, crowded cities benefit in many ways from a lessening of driving. Some cities, like Paris, have already had to enact a partial ban on driving due to a heavy smog layer. Other cities, like Beijing, is even more polluted, and cities in this country suffer as well. If less people drove, the air would be clearer, as was the case in Paris.

Also, there is less crowding when less people are driving. Anyone who has driven through or lived in a large city knows just how bad congestion and traffic jams can be. Less driving would mean less congestion, making it easier for people to get to work, school, or other locations on time. When Paris enacted its driving ban of those with evennumbered licence plates, congestion went down sixty percent.

Finally, using an alternative to cars can save money."
5174760d,0,"Cars have become apart of the everyday life of the average person. It's a mode of transportation that everyone uses in every second of their life though it is faster then walking itself, cars are not always helpful to us. Sources indicate that, by limiting car usage it is possible to relieve stress and reduce pollution.

Limiting the use of cars can bring less stress to the everyday driver. When in a car, it is easy to see when the driver is stressed out. Stress accumulates with traffic jams or when someone is becoming infuriated by another driver, who is driving right in front of the other driver and going really slow. There are people who have seen there stress levels drop when they are not in or don't own a car. For instance, a community in Vauban, Germany, at least 70 percent of their residents don't own a car, while 57 percent sold their car to move there. A woman, Heidrun Walter, who is a resident there stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""Source 1. This verifies how people can get away from stress by just not having a car. In Bogota, Colombia, there is a day when automobiles are banned for a day, with the exemption of buses and taxis. This day has become very popular, and is a ""good opportunity to take away stress""Source 3, as said by Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man who rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife on that day. On this day millions Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of any traffic jam, when a driver gets stressed out he most, as stated in source 3. This shows the number of people who participated in this event and also shows their, less stressful, alternative modes of transportation.

Along with relieving stress, pollution will become less of a problem. Cars are beneficial when it comes transportation, but they can cause harm to the environment as well. Pollution is a major problem in the today's world, and with the number of cars that are in use everyday it will only become worse. Smog or any other type of pollution can cause a city or even a country to take action. Such a Paris, Fance, who put a ban on driving to reduce pollution in their city, which rivaled Beijing, China, known as the one the most polluted cities in the world, as said in source 2. This strenghens the problems that cars pose on the world, these problems can lead to delivery companies losing money because the ban was put up and won't be lifted until the smog is gone. In addition, more information about car pollution can be found in source 1. There it talks about how cars are the ""linchpin"" of suburbs, and how they're ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drasticallly reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" In some places this is slowly resolving itself places such as the United States have seen a drop in miles driven per person since it's peak in 2009. Sociologists believe that, ""it will have beneficial implications carbon emissions and the environment""Source 4. This indicates that, while it is a major issue it is not impossible to solve it.

Cars are an easy and fast form of transportation, but they can also cause harm to people and the environment. No matter how beneficial cars are to us, wouldn't it be better to limit the use of them? This way if cars usage is limited, then the less problems we face."
7b03bdee,0,"Cars have been a part of our culture and society for a very long time now, but this might need to change as limiting the usage of care would lead to substance benefits to our society. these benefits are a lowered carbon footprint, not having to spend as much on upkeep and lowered public transportation costs, and more closely knit communities with healthier people.

To begin, limiting car usage would greatly reduce our carbon footprint thus help the environment. This is because emissions from cars produce around 12 percent of the greenhouse gasses in Europe and could be up to 50 percent in certain carintensive areas in the United states. If we where to cut down on driving there would be a significant reduction in the pollution in the environment. Paris is already enacting laws around this where only people with odd license plates where able to drive one day and even plate numbered cars the other. This has lead to less congested roads and lower amount of smog in the city.

Another draw to limiting car usage lies in lowered cost of public transportation and less money having to be spent on car upkeep and insurance. If people where to use more public transportation instead of personal cars people not have to worry about needing a car and instead keep the money that would normally go to upkeep and insurance to use on other things. Furthermore if public transportation became more nessisary, then public transportation will be cheaper such as in Paris where public transportation became free for the week when they where testing the new law.

Lastly with a reduction in car usage there would be better suburban planning like in Vauban, Germany and people getting more exsersize. Over in Vauban driving cars is severly limited so locations like shopping centers are a walk away from houses and the city is more closly knit with more bike and pedestrian paths. With people walking more that would help with the growing obesity problem Amarica is currently facing and could lead people to live healthier lifestyles In conclusion limiting car usage would be a very fruitful endevear because of the reduction of our carbon footprint, not having to pay car insurance and lowered cost of public tranportation, and more closly knit communities away from the roar of an engine the world would be much better off."
921654a9,1,"Dear Florida state senator, I highly suggest we keep the Electoral College for many reasons, I believe to be the most valued being, with Electoral College, we can insure the certainty and fariness of the outcome. Majority of states award electoral votes with a winner takes all, type of deal. For instance, when no candidate has majority of vote, it becomes a bit of a hectic presidential election, but by using Electoral College, the result is a clear winner. Also, it is insured that there is no region that has enough electoral votes to elect a president alone. Which is great! If a candidate was eligible to be elected by a single regions appeal, that president is extremely unlikely to be a successful president.

Many people believe that Electoral college is unfair, they claim that the candidates feel they dont have to spend much time in the states that they feel they have no chance of winning in, but in reality, instead of avoid the states the candidates feel they wont get votes from, they should probably campaign there, and try to win some votes. It's about making the people like you, making them want to vote for you, not feel avoided by you, and if the candidates still dont see it that way, Electoral College has solved this problem by incorporating ""Swing States."" Voters in these tossup states listen extremely closely to the competing candidates. These voting are often the most thoughtful because they know they are going to be the deciding factor in the election.

because no region of voters can decide the election, and there is even a deciding factor of thoughtful people who are listening closely to the election, Electoral College becomes not only the fairest, but also the most successful way to elect a president."
b07f65ef,0,"Limiting car usage could come off as absurd to some people. They ask ""Why would I reduce my use of something that gets me to my desired destination the fastest?"" Despite the fact that cars appear to be more convenient, the harm they do to the Earth far outweighs the benefits. Cars have become more and more prevalent in the entire world since World War II, as society has been built around the car and its ease of use. This unremitting usage of the car has resulted in a shocking amount of pollution to the Earth. The reduction of car usage is advantageous to the environment. Cars produce so much pollution, have a gradual decuction in use would have positive effects on the environment.

The greatest advantage of limiting car usage is the positive effects it would have on the environment. It is common knowledge that the Earth is in a state of selfdestruction, with humans pouring in incredible amounts of greenhouse gases into it. A high percentage of these harmful emissions come from cars and other gaspowered vehicles. If car usage was limited, a much healthier Earth would result. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" passenger cars were responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and nearly 50 percent in highly congested cities across the United States. With this in mind, cutting these numbers down, even if only in half, would bring about such prosperity to the environment that benefits would soon be noticed. These figures show that the reduction of car usage is pivotal in the fight to protect the environment. Also in the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" it is said that car usage became so heavy in Paris that it developed insane amounts of smog, rivaling that of Beijing, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Clearly the root of the problem for Paris was the abundance of car usage, which once limited, reduced the smog greatly. This proves that cars can be a huge problem for the environment, but limiting the usage will have near immediate benefits. Again the environmental benefit of limiting car use is seen in the article ""The End of Car Culture."" The article states that a limit to car usage would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's eissions."" This article does not only say that cars are large part of pollution, but it also directly claims that less usage would be good for the environment. Limiting car usage is very important to maintaining the Earth as it is now. It is gradually becoming more and more polluted, and the limiting of vehicle use can stop that.

Despite the convenience of the car, it is such a harm to the enironment that its limiting of usage is absolutely neccesary. Several exmaples point out that cars are one of the biggest means of pollution, as it seems everyone is always drving them. Limiting car usage is one of the best things that can be done to save the environement. It is obvious that the preservation of our planet is far more important than the convenience of turning a five minute walk into a short one minute trip. With the ecological benefits of the limit of car usage, this limit of usage is defnitly advantageous."
4b81d15e,1,"I believe that the electoral college should not be kept because it is an unfair system of voting. There are flaws in the electoral college system that make it an unfair system to choose our president. Some of the things that are wrong with the electoral college are that voters can't control whom their electors vote for, in case of a tie there is not a fair way to pick the president, and the winnertakeall system is unfair to voters.

In the electoral college voters aren't essentially voting for a president but they are voting for a group of electors who will then elect a president. The electors can be picked in many different ways. Sometimes they are they are picked at state conventions, they can be picked at state party's central committee, or sometimes the presidential candidate picks them themselves according to Bradford Plumer source 2. Plumer says that voters can't always control who their electors vote for and sometimes voters get confused on who to vote for. The system to pick electors can be bias. For example in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature almost achieved in replacing the Democratic electors with electors who would not elect John F. Kennedy. Meaning if Kennedy would have gotten the popular vote in Louisiana, he still would not have gotten the electoral votes in the state.

In the case of a tie, the electoral college would yet again be an unfair system. If there was a tie in the election, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. In that election, each state has only one vote. So a state with a bigger population has the same say than a state with a smaller population. According to Plumer, because many voters vote one party for president and another party for Congress, the House's selection will not entirely reflect the will of the people. A tie in the electoral college is possible beacause the amount of electoral votes is 538 which is an even number source 3.

The electoral college is also unfair to voters because of the winnertakesall system. The winnertakesall system awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate source 1. According to Plumer because of the winnertakesall system candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning source 2. Counterclains suggest that because the election depends on the vote of swing states, voters there are more thoughtful and should be the ones to decide how the election goes Richard A. Posner, source 3. The comment that voters in swing states are more thoughtful is vague not all voters in swing states have to be media literic, and it is unfair to other states if only the swing states are important to the candidates. Other states will not get enough and fair information about the presidential candidates.

In total, the electoral college is an unfair way to choose our presidents. The method has a lot of bias and doesn't give a fair voice to all the states and its voters. The method has a lot of flaws and is a nondemocratic way to elect our presidents."
92d2d691,0,"Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, and Audi. What do these car companies have in common? Less people are intrested in them, limiting car usage in certain places has lead to the popularity and need of owning a car decrease. Which so that there are advantages to limiting car usage such as less pollution and less traffic.

To begin, limiting car usage can lessen the amount of pollution in the air. Pollution is a topic used when hybrid cars are being talked and how they use less gas and pollute less but what about no pollution at all. How can we stop pollution? By no longer needing cars because ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Elizabeth Rosenthal paragraph 5. Fifty percent in the U.S. of greenhouse gas that is outrageous. As Americans we need to see that the greenhouse gases are causing all the global warming and animals becoming extinct because the environment around them is changing in ways they aren't used to. Limiting greenhouse gases is a must if pollution one day is going to stop. Also, limiting car use can benefit getting rid of the amount of useless gases in our atmosphere. As humans we need oxygen to live but in our atmosphere we currently have less then twenty percent of oxygen. We breathe in nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. In order to get rid of one or two of these gasses we need to limit the car use because limiting car use ""Will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Elizabeth Rosenthal paragraph 34. Cars make up so much of our gas emissions which is a huge reason to why the air is so mixed with many different gasses that our body just dosen't need, and so much smog and air pollution that is heating everything up and killing our planet that we currently inhabit. Unless we have colonies on Jupiter and Mars it seems like we are only killing ourselves.

To continue, limiting car usage can help lower the amount of traffic on the street. When diriving people always get mad when there is traffic or if they are caught in rush hour, why not just say getting to my job is a two minute drive I should just walk. Plus traffic can cause accidents wether it's someone in a hurry, or road rage, or just a complete accident, they happen. France at one point banned even number licence plate cars from driving on certain days and odd number licence plate cars on another to limit pollution, but one intresting stat from when they put the restrictions in place ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Robert Duffer paragraph 14. Traffic down sixty percent in such a large city which also has to help the tourist who don't have to wait so long for their taxi driver to get to the Eiffel Tower. Having traffic down such a huge percentage is an enourmous thing to have in a large area like that because an accident in that city can ruin a lot of people's days so limiting car usage can help in that situation. Also, every year in Cloumbia they have a day without cars to limit pollution and to encourage everyone to get out more and to walk and run around in the city of Bogota which is the city in which the day is held. Columbia limiting there use even if it's once a year is great where ""Rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic."" Andrew Selsky paragrah 28. Limiting car use for one day a year even helps for one day of traffic where rush hours have very little traffic where the only people on the road are the people who don't want to follow the day with no cars. Having the little bit of traffic extremely helps tourist and people who have to use cabs to get around the city to go to work.

To conclude, major car companies like BMW and Jaguar need to watch out because not only is the popularity in cars not as high anymore, the need for them might be just as low because of countries stepping in and limiting car use to help lower the amount of pollution and traffic as they are helping to make the world a better place."
aa3d7e4a,1,"Dear Senator, I am writing to you to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There are many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons I am going to point out ot you are, certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. There are also some reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College. For example voters vote for a slate of electors not the president.

First of all two reasons for keeping the Electoral College would be a certainty of outcome. Even though a dispute over an Electoral College vote is possible it is more likely to occur over a popular vote. A reason for this is the winning candidate's share of Electoral College exceeds his share of popular vote. For example, in a article called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the 51.3 percent rodney received. Because of the winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory.

Another reason would be you avoid run off elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem no one candidate receiving a majority of votes. For example, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the poplar votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.

Two more reasons for keeping the Electoral College are swing states and big states. The winnertakeallmethod of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate to focus campaigning in tossup states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaigning going on. They are also more likely to be more thoughtful voters. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by the malapportion,ent of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

A reason for not keeping the electoral college is that voters vote for a slate of electors not the president. These electors can be anyone not holding public office. The problem with is that electors can vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the candidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are chosing the president they want.

In conlcusion please take my reasons for keeping the Electoral College into consideration. Again those reasons are certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. Also the reason not to keep the Electoral College is voters don't vote for a president, but a slate of electors who do."
828f8762,1,"Florida Senators, The Electoral College is an unfair process. With multiple presidents winning the popular vote and losing their presidency, it is undemocratic. Myself, along with many other people across the state, believe that elections should be based on popular vote rather than the decisions of 538 electors. Although the Electoral College has its advantages, I believe that a majority vote by the people of the United States would be more accurate as well as fair.

The Electoral College is a winnertakesall system, meaning that candidates spend lots of time campaigning in the ""swing"" states rather than others. In 2000, seventeen states didn't even get to see the candidates. This means that almost 34% of voters didn't get a real feel for who they will be casting their votes for. Even though presidents should focus their time on big states with larger populations, it is unfair to the smaller states who don't get any visits from their candidates.

With the Electoral College system, voters vote for a slate of electors, rather than the presidents themselves. This means that when you cast your vote for Barack Obama ,for example, you are not voting for him. you are actually voting for a certain number of electors who contribute to the candidate's electoral votes. Electors can be anyone not in public office and they are usually chosen by the state. This is a corrupt system because the electors could be anyone, and change their ideas to not reflect the views of the people. In 1960, Louisiana legislature segregationists almost replaced all of the Democratic electors electors with new Kennedyopposing electors. The errors and problems in this system could be much greater, and government officials must be monitoring it at all times.

In the event of an Electoral College tie, the president election decision would be given to the House of Representatives, and the vicepresident decision to the Senate. This doesn't seem too terribly bad, but one representative from Wyoming would be representing 500,000 voters, and would have as much say as the 55 representatives representing 35 million people inhabiting California. This is not fair because of the widespread views of people in each state. There cannot be one candidate that the whole state agrees on, as people's ideas differ across the states.

There are many reasons to keep, as well as dispose of the Electoral College. The negatives outweigh the positives and a popular vote would be more democratic. We are supposed to be a democracy, and democracies thrive on the views of the people instead of electors."
c1df21f6,1,"It'd be better to stay with the Electoral College when it comes to voting for the president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with every state, they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. Overall the Electoral College tries to keeps things fair for everyone. The Electoral College so far hasn't made a big mistake or elect a horrible president, so there's no need to mess with the voting system. Without the Electoral College, California would have the most votes put in to elect a president.

If there was no Electoral College all these little states like Rhode Island would have a hard time since their votes are rational compared to the big states like California. Richard A. Posner states ""other things being equal, a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does"" which makes things fair for everyone in small states or large states. The one big problem with the Electoral College voting is that there's only 538 of them while the United States consists of over 300 million citizens which makes almost all of the U.S. not voting for their president but instead for the people who vote for them.

Even though that is a pretty big problem, it does help keeps things fair when it comes to the favor of one candidate over the other. With the Electoral College, candidates that come from a certain region like the South aren't praised over more than a candidate from the North. If it were up to the citizens to choose, there'd be favor for candidates from different regions that represent them. Paragraph 19 says, ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president""Posner,19. The same paragraph brings out that no region has enough votes from the Electoral College to elect a president.

Within the Electoral College are people who are better suited to make the huge decision about who gets elected as president. If it were up to anyone to vote, then the whole system would be messed up. The Electoral College has electors who don't focus on candidates from their region or appearances but they focus on who they think would be able to run this nation the best. Even in most cases, the candidate with the more popular vote still wins. Along with that, the Electoral College tries to keep the electoral votes from being too close for disputes and ties.

So overall the Electoral College is better for the people when voting for president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with each state,they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. With the Electoral College, they try to keep things fair for everyone so that we can all be happy."
eae6d838,1,"AnnoyinglyRepetitive commercials, constant news interviews, and a myriad of kisses on the cheeks of stangers babies occur every 4 years. Its been the same process since the start of this country to aid in electing new presidents Designed in eloquence by our founding fathers. On the contrary I do strongly believe that the electoral college was on the lesser side of this eloquence. The grueling process, the unfairness and the overall confusion provided by the electoral college in my opinion make this ""electoral college"" one of the most unintelligent lesser thought out compromises that this country has ever had to abide by.

The electoral college is tiring, The process downrightgrueling, and overratedoutdated. As Americans using the electoral college keeps us hidden. We believe we have a voice when in reality the ""voice"" that we thought we had is barely above a whisper. According to the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" the author Bradford Plumer states that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This statement provided by the author suggests that something so simplesounding turns out to be so complicated. By Americans placing a vote not for themselves but for the electors it is now not in the peoples hands like the government patronizes, even though you may put in a vote to elect a democratic candidate you never know who your state assigned electors might actually vote for, are you tired yet?

In Addition, its unfair to the presidential candidates. Although a presidential candidate may be well liked by people and ""win"" by popular vote that does not nessasarily mean the win in the presidency Although I understand the fact that using the electoral college ensures a winner and avoids runoff elections I still do believe that this process is highly incompetent. The article by Plumer gives the example of the fact that in the 1960's segragationists almost succeeded in fully replacing democratic electors with electors of their choice or in essence ones that opposed of Kennedy. For candidates who place their blood sweat and tears into an election just to have lost by some electors but happend to be wellliked by people is foolish. America is supposed to be a country of the equal, and with the use of the electoral college is the perfect example of why this country could not be any farther away from equal.

Furthermore, the process is confusing. Between the electors, voting and the overall uncertainty it is not worth it. Going through unneeded stress just to further confuse people is idiotic. The presidential election should be elected by popular vote and the goverment shall see to it that the peoples votes are actually counted towards something. I honestly do not believe that the title of ""land of the free, home of the brave should be given to a place where the government can not even see that this scheme no longer works. Its tiring, unfair, and confusing all red flags that this process is in need of some serious fine tuning.

In essence the electoral college is dead. Cheating people out of their rights is dead, and schemery is dead. Our government needs a serious wake up call. They need to open their eyes to the fact that this process is no longer effective and we are not that impressionable as the ones who were before us. The electoral college needs to be laid to rest and we should be alotted all the rights that we have not recieved from this grueling, confusing, unfair process."
0af1d837,0,"Dear fellow citizens of America it has come to my attention that pollution in the United States is getting worse so I have a solution use cars less. It is simple, this will help cut pollution in the U.S as the second biggest polluting factor is gone and can actually help you with a better social life as well as helping rebuild the community.

As mentioned earlier,cars are the second leading cause of pollution in the U.S and cutting that will help stop some pollution by stopping one of the biggest causes. Stopping the use of cars will cut the carbon in the air and this in turn can lead to a healthier lifestyle as well. There are many neighborhoods that are carless and we have received good results from said neighborhoods as well as car free day is becoming a hit in Columbia as well as other parts in central America. This will also make smog a less likely occurrence as no car fumes are getting trapped therefore, cleaner, unpolluted air. This will help prevent the same pollution levels like in Paris pop up here.

A life without cars can also positively affect the social lives of many people. As people are more likely to just walk and talk with friends or just walk or bike to the park. people in carless community like Vauban have even said they feel less stress now that they don't have cars. Young Americans have even started losing interests in cars and would rather take public transport or carpool with friends then just take their own car. And as a result are tighter with their friends and family then before.

People who use cars for transport are less likely to use the sidewalk or ride their bike and as a result sidewalks and bike paths are uneven and ragged. Therefore without cars, things like disrepair sidewalks or roads would come to our attention. For example Car Free Day in Columbia led to the repair of sidewalks and 118 miles of bike roads and more sport centers parks and shopping districts have started to pop up. Getting rid of cars can help us rebuild the community with more parks and public centers and hangouts. This will also lead to better security as less people will get hit by cars, less car accidents and overall better security.

In conclusion my fellow citizens, please consider makeing this community carless. for their are many advantages for doing so in this community from the enviromental, to the social and to the health benefits."
65d7951c,0,"Limiting car usage can be beneficial in many ways. For example, the air would be a lot less poluted if we reduced the amount of cars being used. In a German suburb that rarely ever uses cars, people report that it is less stressful to not own a car.

The advantages of limiting car usage is not only beneficial to people but also to the planet. If people were to limit their car usage, the amount of pollution and smog in the air would be reduced and not be such an issue Paris bans driving due to smog, P19.

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog Paris bans driving due to smog, P14.

""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Paris bans driving due to smog, P10. Regardless of the partial driving ban, almost 4,000 drivers were fined. This shows that some people do not really care about all the pollution they are bringing the Earth. Which gives people more reason not to limit car usage. If people are not going to try limiting down the usage, other poeple will follow that and not do so either. So limiting car usage is really important for the planet and for us.

The less cars we use the less smog there will be in the air.

Trying to limit car usage is not a new thing, the day without car is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota, Colombia in the mid 1990s Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P27. In Colombia, the rain did not stop the people from participating in the carfree day, and it had an effect in two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, which joined in the carfree day for the first time Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P25. So the car free day is rapidly making its way into cities, so that it can help limit the amount of cars being used.

Limiting car usage is very benefitial because it will also help keeping young people safe.

Researcher have found that driving between young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 The end of car culture, P41. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn"" The end of car culture, P33. ""If the pattern persisits... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportaion is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" The end of culture, P34. If the usage of cars is reduced, people could be a lot happier than the are now. Since 2001, resarchers believe that young people do not make getting their licenses a priority anymore, which does improve the fact that people are getting a step closer to helping reduce the amount carbon in the air. If people could organize their schedual around being able to walk or take public transportation to the location they need to be at, there would be no need to use cars, to an extent of course. Not everyone can there their schedual to do that, but the more people that contribute to it the better.

""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter Car free cities, P3. Limiting the amount of car usage will not only help to reduce the amount of carbon in the air, but it could also help the people live a happier life like Heidrun Walter. Although not everyone feels that way, whether people like it or not, it is better for them to reduce car usage not only for their sake but also for the worlds sake.

If car usage was to be limited, not only would the world be rid of more carbon, but it could also have a great impact on peoples lives.

382c464d,0,"Cars, they help us get from point A to B in a shorter amount of time, but at what cost. Cars are a large source of stress, produce large amounts of pollution, and seem, even now, to be going out of style. Cars are a luxury, not a necessity, and now they might not even be as useful. More and more people are putting down the car keys and choosing instead to take a bike or bus. Cars are just too stressful to be a necessity.

In Vauban, Germany, many people are giving up engines. According to the New York Times, ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars,"" showing that life can go on efficiently even without a car. Life might actually improve without those money eating tanks. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. This car free philosophy is even becoming a trend! There are hundreds of groups in the United States promoting communities that are more independent of cars, called ""car reduced"" communities. But stress isn't the only thing cars produce. Cars are huge contributes to pollution, and reducing car usage would greatly benefit the environment.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent is some carintensive areas in the united states, according to the New York Times. Paris actually enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of nearrecord pollution. The ban was enforced with a 31 fine. Even with 4,000 drivers fined, congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared enough that the ban could be lifted the next day. Using more environmentally inclined sources of transportation will definetely help leave a cleaner planet for future generations, and the generations already here. Cars are convenient for short term gratification, but the long term effects might devastate the environment. Cars are not needed, and might not even be preferred for much longer.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 in the united states. Bogota, Colombia even becan a ""carfree day"" in with all cars, besides busses and taxis, are banned in this capital city of 7 million for an entire day. Violaters of this ban are fined 25. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Plaza. This event is even starting to spread. For the first time two other Colombian cities have joined the event. Using cars is becoming less and less common, and it's a trend the environment can enjoy.

In conclusion, cars are a hiderance. Cars are stressful and cumbersome objects, getting rid of them would help reduce stress in the population. Cars are high contributes to pollution, creating smog and causing problems. Also, cars are a comodity that is being used less and less. People are putting down the car keys and picking up a bike."
d4b3d8d2,0,"Many places such as Vauban, Germany have given up the usage of cars. Vauban is a goring trend in europe and the United states because of the positive effects of not using cars. One of the biggest examples is polution, also the removal of cars would ultimately lead to a financial increase in our economy, lastly making this change positively effects our future.

First I would like to talk about a huge problem we face as a society today and that is green house gasses. You may not think that these are a big deal put if left unchecked they can become a huge problem. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas. This can become a huge problem ranging from acid rain to climate change. An example of what polution can do to a city is in paris they are putting a partial ban on cars because of how how bad there polution is. There was a huge smog problem because green house gasses were being trapped because of hot days and cold nights.

Also this change can have amazing effects on that areas economy. Because there will be no cars people will take the bus witch is less than paying for gas or they can walk to closer places. Also gas prices would decrease for other forms of transportation because there wouldnt be cars demanding the fuel. family could sell there cars and spend the money they were using to fund there car other thing witch will lead to the people being happier. Also the removal of cars will lead to the creation of jobs because they will need people to operate public transportation.

Lastly the removal of cars will have a positive effect on the future of our world. With the track were on now the world is estimated to heat up and have negative consequences on our society. these climate changes may seem small but they can have drastic effects. in china there is a lake that is so polluted you set the top of it on fire because there is so much pollutants on it. also this chang has coralation with peoples happiness. Were already started down the path of less cars, recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

For the following benefits is why we should stop using cars and continue with the idea of using public tranportation and walking. Cars creat polution, its better for our economy to stop the use of cars and this will poitivley effect out furute."
6cad8297,0,"Congestion, the amount of car traffic in a specific area, is significantly decreasing due to a new idea that has sprung:limiting car usage. Places such as Vauban, Paris, Bogota, Cali and Valledupar are participating in a program that's made to decrease car usage. Some of these cities enjoy Day Without Cars, a holiday that ""promotes alternative transportation and reduces smog"". Selsky 1 Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Limiting car usage promotes a healthier, cleaner environment for all. By using alternative transportation, such as buses, taxis, biking or even walking, the amount of greenhouse emission is drastically reduced. Rosenthal 1 The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States are encouraging ""car reduced"" communities, causing legislators to act. This will cut the amount of money spent yearly by U.S. citizens and the government as a whole, reducing the federal transportation bill. Rosenthal 1 Paris, too, momentarily banned driving due to smog. Paris enforced a driving ban that lasted a few days to clear the city's air after a close call to record pollution. Although some people were upset, congestion was down 60 percent, and the smog cleared a few days later. Duffer 1 All in all, diesel usage decreased, leaving a ""greener"" environment in its place.

President Obama has also wanted ""to curb the United states greenhouse gas emissions,"" Rosenthal 1, he revealed last week. Although the United states rate of car ownership per person and per household has started to decrease, there are still more things that could be done to create a longterm cultural shift. Rosenthal 1 New York has recently created a bikesharing program that has done remarkably well. Many cities have proposed plans to make personal vehicle ownership impractical or undesirable. Rosenthal 1 Even Bill Ford, the owner of the Ford Car Company, suggested an idea to creat cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" at the Mobile World Congress last year. Rosenthal 1 Bogota, Colombia specifically enjoys a yearly carfree day in which the only exception of vehicle transportation are buses and taxis. This prevents traffic jams, reduces air pollution, and cuts the many costs to cars. Even in rain, the event continued on ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Antanas Mockus, the Bogota Mayor. Selsky 1 Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asucnion, Paraguay, said that ""these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" Smog reduction, costcutting, stressrelieving and trafficjamfree, participating in this global change is an opportunity you won't want to miss."
920c2732,1,"Dear State Senator, it is more favorable to keep the splendid method of the Electoral College and not to change it to election by popular vote for the United States President. The Electoral College method is more preferable because it helps to avoid runoff elections, and less numerical values.

Using the Electoral College to vote is more efficient because of it's aid to avoid runoff elections. As Richard A. Posner states,"" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" It also can help candidates running for president to avoid going to states that they know whose vote will have no effect. For example, Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California or how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college. There isn't even any pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority vote that was cast leading to a clear winner.

Furthermore, using the Electoral College to select the President can help to reduce numerical values. Even though a citizen's vote doesn't automatically go to the candidate running for office and actually selects the electors that will select the President, the amount of votes it reduced greatly. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, rather than a estimate of 500 million votes total. Only a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect a President. This includes one for each member in the House of Representatives and two for Senators. With most states having a winnertakeall system it even more so reduces the numerical value to that of just electors to vote for the winning presidential candidate while voters in tossup states are more likely to pay closer attention to the campaign. Those voters are more likely to be more thoughtful on average. They also receive the most information and attention from candidates.

Although, some articles and people consider the Electoral College method to be unfair to voters. Bradford Plumer says,""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" Even so, knowing their vote will have no effect, they will have kess incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were to be picked by popular vote.

Continuing, as was said before to the State Senator, it's a much more favorable idea to forward with the Electoral College method rather than popular vote because it will help avoid many timeconsuming problems like runoff elections and high numerical values."
23745610,0,"Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certain places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are actually happy that they put this new type of law. Many people preferred to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help reduce this problem. On mondays motorists with evennumbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emissions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it."
0a11dfd8,1,"The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that's not all. It's also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.

Imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. Voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn't sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

There are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have separated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don't believe it could. Since there are less people making the decision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their decision, so they deserve recognition too.

The electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let's give Americans the chance for a fair vote."
a9d627af,1,"Who are voters voting for? Whoever they are voting for, it certainly isn't the president. The Electoral College has the potential to cause a nationwide catastrophe, which is why changing the election to popular vote is the best way. The Electoral College should be abolished because of the ""disaster factor"", prospect of a tie, and the fact that more citizens vote in the presidential election compared to the electoral election.

The disaster factor is exactly what it sounds like: a disaster. This ""disaster"" is described as the event where electors defy the people they are representing. For example, this happened in the 2000 presidential vote when Al Gore won the public vote, but lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush. This means that the electors voted by the people of their state changed their minds about which president they were voting for. This resulted in the opposing vote turnouts in the 2000 presidential election. As said in Source 2, ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" Although some people may argue that it is very rare for something like this to happen, the fact that there is a chance that it could is overwhelming. Clearly, against even the smallest odds, the Electoral College can cause a catastrophe.

A tie would cause a real predicament in a presidential election. In the case of a tie, the choice is given to the House of Representatives. This means that there is an unequal amount of electoral voters. Source 2 says, ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Once again, the Electoral College has faulted a simple tie could throw the whole election off. Why would the vote be passed on to the House if there is already a popular vote? If there is already another vote in place and the votes are counted, why not just put those votes to use? Obviously, if a tie could mess up a national vote, then it's time to change our ways.

Although each state decides its electors, how many people are actually voting for the electors? According to Source 3, about onehalf of the eligible American population voted in 2012's presidential election. If only half of the population is voting for a nationwide presidential election, how many people are going to vote for a small, instate election? It isn't clear enough that although the presidential election is bigger, the electoral election is much more important. However, if we just had a popular vote instead of the Electoral College, everyone would vote in the presidential election because everyone already knows the importance of the presidential election. Yet, people aren't aware enough of the importance of the electoral vote and although the government has tried to stress the importance of voting it, nobody seems to catch on. It is evident that a large percentage of the population does not understand the need to vote in the electoral election. People simply do not understand that this election determines the outcome of the presidential election, which is why it shouldn't even exist.

The Electoral College is regarded as a nondemocratic method of selecting a president. It is true hypocracy and should be replaced because of the ""disaster factor"", prospect of a tie, and the fact that more citizens vote in the presidential election compared to the electoral election. The presidential election isn't a nationwide election it is an election that takes place in a little room where 538 electors decide the political fate for millions of people living in the United States of America."
0a8e65ab,1,"Many people are in belief of evaporating the idea of having the Electoral college. A Gallop poll taken in 2000 shows that citizens would rather have a direct election. As a member of the United States you must think of all the possibilities. Yes, the electoral college was once a great process, but now there are some changes are in need of being made.

The electoral college is a process in which we select electors. This long and dragged out procedure is many steps that take months to prepare for. First, there must be a selection of the electors which are chosen by the states. Then the meeting must be planned and taken place. Who and why is a hard aspect to decide on voting day for those who have been chosen to be the electors. Votes for president and Vice President must be made. After voting the counting beings. The Electoral College has a total of 538 members. Over 270 votes must be made to elect the President. This process can easily be shortened by using a direct election.

By having a direct election everyone's voice is heard. This means less arguing in the states. Citizens enjoying believing their thoughts are not being avoided. Having the Electoral College taking place is highly unwanted in the US. This is because the people believe a direct vote is more efficient way for them to show who they believe is worthy of being President and Vice President.

Each candidate running for office retains a group of electors from a state. These electors are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. This means if a person doesn like the electors chosen they feel like they still dont have a say of what is going on in the presidential election.

In conclusion, The Electoral College is no longer a process citizens enjoy. This procedure is too long and citizens dont encourage it. Many people believe that this branch of government feels they will lose more power if the Electoral College is given up on. Using a direct election will spare the arguments and will allow us to have an easy and manageable process in which to vote on our leading man."

, Germany residents don't use cars, they dont even have room for cars. The only way to get a parking space is at your house which you have to buy for 40,000, along with a home or large garages at the the edge of the development. Streets are completely ""carfree"" besides a few streets on the edge of the community. 70% doesn't even own cars. Heidrun Wlater, former car owner says ""When I had a car was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" They are healthier and less tense because they walk, and bicycle keeping their self fit and active.

, France banned driving due to smog. Evennumbered plates one day then the next day oddnumber plates, the ones who did use there cars they got a fine of 22euro 31. They did that for five days. 4,000 people were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded due to there reaction to the fine. A car being droven every other day helps out with the polution. it cuts back on the polution if it's not running putting it in the environment. It's like if you drive once a week then you are only putting a little bit of polution in the environment. You aren't putting as much as you would be if you drove everyday a week.

, Colombia They walk, bike, hike, skate, and take buses to work during the carfree days. It's been the third year in a row that they have had this day. The goal is to reduce smog and it works. Violaters are fined 25. More cities like, Cali, and Valledupar joined the event. They are taking a stand against polution and cleaning up the smog. The bicyclers made 118 miles of bike paths. Just for this day. ""This is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said business man Carlos Arturo Plaza.

United States of America , President Obama's goal is to curb the green house gas emissions. Everyone is asking ""Has America passed peak driving?"" In 2013 Americans drove 9% per person below the peak which in January 1995 that's where we were. Cars per house hold has came down. There are cellphone apps now a days thet help out with car pooling. Instead of driving yourself to work ask your coworkers to switch days with you. Some days you drive them to work and other days, they drive you to work. You both would be saving on gas and putting less polutuion in the air. People from the ages 16 to 39 yearsolds are just getting thier license, while older people maintain their license was the research Mr. Sivak's has found. Many people just get jobs where they can walk to work, use public transportation or car pool with friends.

Walking, riding a bicycle, hiking, and skating are all ways to get somewhere without creating polution. If there is a way to cut back on polution then you should take that oppertunity. Carpooling with a friend, or coworker is also a way to cut back on polution. Instead of two cars coming from an area to go to the same area they should just use one car to go to that area instead of taking to cars for it. My point is save the environment and create less polution like Paris, Bogota, and Vauban. They created way to help out the environment, you take a stand and you make a change."
4591c859,0,"""When I had a car, I was always tense,"" Heidrun Walter said in the article, in German Suburb, Life Goes On Without cars, in the New York Times, ""I'm much happier this way."" In Vauban, Germany, people do not use cars. They find other means of transportation, such as biking and walking. In Bogota, the construction of bicycle paths has made 118 miles of passages for residents. According to David Goldberg, ""All our development since World War II has been centered around the car."" While that is not entirely true, it does have a good point. We should move on from the allpowerful box with wheels.

One major reason for not using cars is pollution. As most of us know, pollution is bad for the environment, and for most life on Earth. Unfortunately, our use of cars and power plants is generating pollution faster then plants can take it out of the atmosphere. ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"", Elisabeth Rosenthal said. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", 60% of drivers in Paris stopped after five days of intensifying smog. That means that the smog was dense enough to where it was dangerous for drivers to go anywhere.

The article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" mentions that: ""The turnout for carfree day was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" Why would people continue to participate in carfree day if they hated it so much? Despite the fine of 25, it really isn't a big deal. One of the participants, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Now, how can you simply stop driving? You need to get to your job! Nobody is telling you to move to Vauban. However, biking or walking to the park could help. You don't need a car to go to your neighbor's house. They're right next door. Of course, not using cars is not going to stop the pollution from power plants, but it will certainly slow down how fast it is going into the atmosphere.

We simply can't allow pollution to go where it is going. If we all stop relying on cars to get us to places, we will have enough time to think of an easier solution. Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. There is a chance that being carfree won't be as bad as everyone thinks. It might even be enjoyable. There is also a chance that it will despised."
11619ff1,1,"Dear Senator, The electoral college was a perfect way of electing, in the 1900's. Now, we should be allowing the people of the United States decide who they want to be their president. Not only is this inequality, but it is deceiving and unfair. I know people say ""Life's unfair."" and while it is, we should be doing our best to keep our country in line. We are already in a steep pile of debt. Obama has only made this worse. Why was he elected? Mostly because he is part of a minority. Inequality much?

U.S. citizens are being put to shame by every elector in the electoral college. We have the right to vote, for electors. And these electors barely ever follow suit. Not only do they stray from what the people want, they also take away our authority in the government. If we have the right to vote, then let us vote on wether or not to keep the electoral college. I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one who has these thoughts. I understand that I am simply a child and that you have no reason to listen to me, but if not me, listen to the rest of our country.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

passage 2, paragraph 10 As stated by Bradford Plumer, we do not elect our president. If we did, Al Gore would have been our president in 2000. If all men are equal, then why are you choosing certain people over the U.S. population. It is utterly deceiving to take our votes and throw them away, to make us think that our votes matter when they really don't. If this is who you want to choose our president, then don't have us vote.

Although people say that the electoral college takes away the chance of majority, that's how the system works. How do you think the president wins? They like to call it winnertakesall. That is a nice way to put it. The president is decided by the majority of votes in the electoral college. What puts these electors above me? I am young, but I have a working mind just like my parents. Why do my parents votes get pushed to the side and ignored? The reason is because the U.S. is a lying and unfair country. They tell us that we are the ones who control the government, yet they put our own people above us.

America has been going downhill and that is all that will continue if we dont change something. Getting rid of the electoral college will allow us to prosper. Why listen to a young teenager? Well, I know how it feels to be put on the bottom of the ladder, even if you are the smartest. America knows what is best for us. Not a few people chosen in each state to represent what they themselves want. Let us choose the president once, and if it doesn't work out, then you can continue your way. Just remember, if you never shoot for the moon, you will never reach the stars."
24fbec45,1,"Dear Senator, There has been some recent heat on the topic of the Electoral College. I believe that it is only fair to keep the Electoral College. Although some voters may be upset with the fact that they don't define who wins the presidential election, it is best that way. If there was no Electoral College people with no actual idea of whats going on would vote, and that could have a negative affect. Also if there was no Electoral College there would be an unfair amount of votes in larger states. The last reason is Swing States, which is also a very important part of the voting process.

First and Foremost, the Electoral College may make voters feel like they have no input on the election, but really they decide who the Electoral voters choose. Without Electoral voters, there would be indecisive people voting for a candidate they know nothing about. For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.

Secondly, I believe that having the Electoral College is great because, without it larger states would have more of a say on who becomes president. This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still ""independent voters"". For example, as stated in paragraph twentyone, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twentynine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smaller ones.

Lastly, The Electoral College is a very important part of our voting process becaue of Swing States. As stated in paragraph twenty, voters in tossup states are ""more likely to listen to the campaign and the competing candidates"". These voters know that their votes wont make much of an impression on the election, but pay the most attention anyways. People claim that the most involved voters should be able to decide the elections. Although they don't have much of a say it is nice to know that people do care about the elections and do pay close attention to what is going on.

To conclude my previously stated reasons, I believe that having the Electoral College is a crucial part of the system. Because without it the nation would have so many voters that only cast their votes based off of popular opinion. Also without it larger states would have more of an affect on the votes than the smaller states do. Finally, Swing States are a very important part of voting because voters who know what is going on and actually pay attention do have one of the biggest affects."
cf388f90,1,"Dear state senator, Many people do not think that the Electoral College is not fair, or exact. In fact, people wanted to boycott it in 2000. I suggest that we change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. It is fair to the candidates and to the people of our country, and we should be able to choose our president, not the electors. Also, if we keep the Electoral College, voting will be unfair and it only makes people want to stop voting. I will explain to you the details of these reasons why we should change it in the rest of my letter.

To begin with, we should change to popular voting because it is fair to everyone. The people want a fair election. Presidents can be chosen wisely by the people, and candidates will be chosen fairly. People want a safe election, so that they can feel safe and protected with the president that we all chose together. It is only unfair to not let us have the advantage of expressing our own opinions. That is a reason why we should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president.

The second reason why we should change to popular voting is because we, as in the people of the United States, should have the advantage of voting for our own president, not the electors. The people know what they want and need to vote for the candidate based on their own opinions. Electors have different opinions, which is not fair at all since we are not really voting. They are only changing our votes and not agreeing with the votes of the people. That is the second reason why the government should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president.

A disadvantage of keeping the Electoral College is that it is unfair and it makes less people want to vote for a president. In 2012, only half of the whole United States voted for a president. They did not think voting was really necessary anymore, since we are not really voting. It also makes the people feel worthless since their votes do not really count anymore. We basically do not have a say in our own country, and that is not fair to us or the government. That is why keeping the Electoral College is a bad idea, and we should change it.

This is why you should reconsider changing to popular vote, for the good of our country. It is honestly a much better process for our country , the citizens, and especially for the candidates that want to make a great difference in the place we live in. Popular voting is fair to candidates and people, we should choose our president, not electors, and the Electoral College is unfair and makes less people want to vote. Thank you for reading and listening to my letter. Have a great day."
763f168e,1,"Dear state senator, I ask you to change the voting methods to popular vote instead of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency dont need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the result them being elected as president or not. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates al all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campaign as. ""You may ask yourself why they didn't see any of of this well one thing that both of them share is that they dont have as many electoral collage votes as other states like california that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the presidency and its a winner take all. According to the ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slater of electors, who in turn elect the president."" For example when bush was running for president he was not the most popular in the nation and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more then half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

However According to ""In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. ""The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting methed to The Popular voting to elect The President Of The United states Of America because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A."
a4a1c088,1,"The Electoral College was a system thought up by people who lived in a time much different than our own. And in that time, it made sense. It made sure that those who cast their state's votes for president, the electors, were well informed on the issues and the stance of the candidates for those issues. However, now that everyone has access to a wealth of information through the internet, newspapers and television, this is no longer a problem this is why election by popular vote would be a better system.

With the Electoral College, voters don't have a direct say on who becomes president. They have to trust their votes in the hands of people they don't even know. People who could cast their state's votes for any candidate they want. This system is completely unnecessary now that citizens have a wealth of information about the candidates and their stance on certain topics.

If our nation switched to election by popular vote, everyone's vote would matter. In the Electoral College system, many people in states that are decisively one way or the other, don't vote, knowing that the overwhelming majority of the population of their state is against them. This makes certain people, like Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California, feel that their vote has no power. In an election by popular vote however, every vote matters because the people's votes directly decide the president.

Our Founding Fathers were geniuses to have come up with a system that worked so well in their time, however, old methods don't always stand the test of time. Election by popular vote makes more sense in today's world. The Electoral College eliminates the power of some people's votes and puts those that matter in the hands of people who could do whatever they want with them. This is why election by popular vote would be a better system for determining the president than the Electoral College."
9b7c31e7,1,"Abolishing the Electoral College sounds like an excellent idea. The election by popular vote is most definetely without a doubt, more fair for the people. Why are 538 people the ones who get to decide who becomes president and not the rest of us? The Electoral College is outdated and too old for today society. Lets get rid of this while we can.

The Electoral College was made many years ago by the founding fathers, this can tell you it is outdated. People used to have completely different political views back then, we need a fresh start on how we want it today because things have changed. We the people should vote on what we want now an Electoral College as. a popular vote by the people and decide since it has been over a thousand years later.

""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" says Bradford Plumer in source two. Plumer is right about this, the electoral college is very unfair. How can 538 people decide what happens for the rest of us? It should not be like this, everyone should be equal and all vote then go with the most popular vote for the president. We need to change our ways now before the next election.

Some people may argue like Richard Posner in source three that ""the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue.."", basically saying the electoral college makes things more equal and fair. What is not fair is that everyone doesn't get to vote directly only the electors do. Many people don't agree with Posner and they shouldn't because the electoral college is the wrong way to run things.

Lets make changes to our future, and abolish the Electoral college. We need to have an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Fairness and equality is the route we need to take."

In source 2, paragraph 13, it states ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning in."" Candidates don't take their time in these states because they don't want their beliefs and ideas shut down. They spend some time in these states. The electors for each state help them vote wisely, therefore the absence of presence by these candidates should not be a big ordeal. People want to abolish the Electoral College due to citizens not being able to vote for the president yet they do not realize what this system has provided for us. It provides organization and avoids many, many problems that would likely take place without the Electoral College.

In source 3, paragraph 20, discusses how voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign due to the fact they have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates. These voters are the most thoughtful and should be the ones deciding the election. Also, in paragraph 22, also in source 3 it states how there is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That pressure is reduced by the Electoral College because it produces and reveals a clear winner.

The Electoral College was created many years ago and has brought organization to our voting system. Why should we try to fix something that is not broken? Changing the system would be illogical. Electors are wiser at making these final decisions than we are. Wwe deserve an input, which we can all agree we recieve, but we shouldn't make the final decisions of our country aimlessly. Electors are people who know exactly what to look for in a president and they are more knowledgable on the subject. The Electoral College is the wisest process we can use in electing our presidents."
b3532869,0,"Limiting car usage will give us many benefits. A projects such as Vauban and BOGOTA were completed to show us the multitude of advantages received from it.

Reducing car usage would be excellent for our environment. Research shows us that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States""Rosenthal. Our world is very materialistic and sometimes we forget that to even have life, we must have the environment. ""Cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""Rosenthal. Therefore, limiting the amount of cars would allow us to have more efficient green houses, and more land area for plants.

Money is also a huge factor here. The government spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in the transportation department. By lowering the number of cars on the road, the less wear and tear is done to them. This would be beneficial in many departments because then we would have more money for the things we need but cannot afford in our area and or country. Infact, ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transportation""Rosenthal.

Driving also causes stress. Traffic jams, new or confusing road signs, attitudes of passengers, are all distribution of stress, especially when you get lost! If the amount of driving we did by ourselves was cut back, we could also cut back stress. BOGOTA helps to prove this, and even says that violaters of no car day were ""fined 25Selsky.

Lastly, if we do not put a stop to so much driving, our personal health may be in risk. According to souce 4, ""the car industry is the second largest in the world."" This means that the air is constantly being polluted with exhuast. Which also means that what's in your lungs at this very moment, could be a lot more than just oxygen. It's very scary to think that the same chemicals it takes to run your car, might just be what's floating around in your body. This could lead to multiple health problems and future diseases. Therefore, this issue needs to be taken control of immediately.

In conclusion, reducing car usage would be an amazing thing to do for oursleves and the people around us. We would save our air and bodies from being polluted, we would save money, and save time not stressing out. Who doesn't want these things? Limiting car usage would be a fantastic idea."
32d18e99,0,"Limiting car usage can seem like a far fetched idea, but in reality, it helps us more than hurts us. Limiting the usage of cars helps reduce pollution, reduce smog, and reduce the amount of obese people in the world. By doing so, it's not a bad idea to limit car usage.

Pollution, the cause of the ice caps melting, is an ongoing battle that we seem to be losing. As it states in Source One, ""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of the green house gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"". If the cities in the United States had these limitations then our percentage woul rapidly decline. In Europe, they have already taken notice of their percentages of pollution and have started to have experimental towns in which there are car limitations put in place. In the town of Vauban, as written in Source One, ""There are only two places to park, the large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space for forty thousand dollars,along with a home"". This is a good way to get rid of all the pollution, by having no where to park and if they want to park, they will have to pay for their space. It also states ""As a result, seventy percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and fiftyseven percent sold a car to move there"". The people that live there most of them are carless so they don't spend their money on a parking spot, meanwhile some people sold their cars to either to avoid paying for a spot, or to join in the experiment of limiting the usage of cars.

Smog, is a citafect of to much pollution in one area. Smog has gotten so bad that Paris, accordingto source Two, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. The ban was partial as in the article it says "" on Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a twentytwo euro fine thirtyone dollars and the next day it would apply to the odd numbered license plates"". This caused almost four thousand drivers to be fined and twentyseven cars were impounded, according to the article. Smog is a problem that can be fixed just like how Paris got rid of their smog by car usage limits.

Car limitations don't just help the environment they can help us as well. Humans have become very obese in the last fifty years then they have been in any other time period. You can blame the fast food, but you can eat fastfood and stay healthy. Car limitations make you walk or ride a bike which can get you healthier. I'm not saying go out and be Usain Bolt or Lance Armstong but it can help people to be healthier at the same time as being helpful to the environment.

Car usage limitations are a great idea, although most people wouldn't enjoy it. It helps reduce pollution which is the biggest threat globaly. It helps dissolve smog from highly car populated areas. The limits can even help humans by having them ride bikes or walk. The thought of limitations are not accepted by most people but if this is what we must do to keep the earth healthy then we have to do it."
4a0e22f0,1,"THere has been quite a lot of recent talk of whichh the national government should keep the Electoral COllege, or change to an election by popular vote for the president of the UNited states. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress""Source 1: What is the Electoral College? by the office of the federal register. IT has been established by the founding fathers to make a compromise between popular vote and election vote in congress. Popular representation is a vote for qualified citizens to take an individual vote cast to the state whichh then is transferred to a representative whole. the are many good effects this popular representation has on the country, but the senator should keep the Electoral College without a shout of a doubt.

one of the most important reasons we should keep the electoral college process is that in this process, states pay much more attention to the electors due to having swing states. the people who decide on our president should be most intrigued and the most concerning ones. ""voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that theu are going to decide the electionin defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president, by richard a. posner, subtitle Swing States"". MAny voters that are in swing states, whichh are stated that cast the majority of votes in the system with higher amounts of population, therefore congress representatives.

another reason why the gov should keep the electoral college is because it resorts unwanted balance. ""there is no pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes casy that pressure whichh would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, whichh invariably produces a clear winner"" so what this quote from the passage is saying is that no candidate recieves a majority if the votes cast, due to each states fair rep of the population without being overwhelmed by the most populated states such as florida, california, and texas. While you may believe that the popular representation vote may be overwhelmingly more accurate to the people wants , you are wrong. the electoral college is a process in which hgives the people wants in a state to an elector who then gives you an equal chance one voting for what you pleased. he may be the ""biggest"" or ""smallest"" amount of electoral votes, but as a state in a whole yu may recieve a big surprise that there is no clear winner as each president may not be just familiat with one region such as the north east, or the southwest, etc.

so as you can see, the government should keep an electoral colllge process instead of the popular representation vote. it would be greatly appreciated to the United States People who may be under informed of how grest an opportunity for an idea such as this to vote up, or they might be over informed of fallacy information of our election process now."
9537400e,1,"In the year 2000 there was a presidential election. The two canadate running were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an important question that we the people should be asking, do we really pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show? The Electoral College is an out dated system that we keep because the government wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to decide.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers and made as a ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifies citizens."" The Electoral College vote on the President and the Vice President. It has 538 members and for there to be a winner a canadate, has to get a majority of 270 electoral votes. Your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional degation. The problem here is that there is 300 million people in this connery and only 538 people get to vote on who is going to be president.

Also most states have a Winner takes all system were the winner of the majority gets all of the votes. For example florida has 29 electoral votes so if one canadate get 15 which is the majority he will get all 29. Because of this there is not an accurate repisentaion of what the state thinks.

The last reason it is not a good system is because the people's votes do not matter. In the 2000 election Gore had won the peoples votes and Bush had on the Eletoral votes. now Bush became president even tho Gore had won with the people. The biggest problem with the Electoral College is the fact that it over rules the people. If the Eletoral College wins it does not matter how many people vote for the other person running it will not matter."
a79df0df,0,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pollution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraints and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change."" Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the environment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to exercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the environment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to exercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money."
ba58f9e5,0,"Limiting car usage is a good idea. Limiting cars usage it a wonderful idea for many reasons. most people have the ability to live there life without cars, this would help cut back on pollution, and for most people it would be cheaper. Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not.

To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run out of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want.

Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad pollution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide pollution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutants and it causes lot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas.

Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there licenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas.

Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper."
119d35c6,0,"Think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere. I know I drive to school, to lacrosse practice, and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis. Some people may claim that driving is a positive aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timely fashion, but driving in excess has some serious consequences. Although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives, and that cutting down on driving would not be advantageous, limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages. Cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air, and make us healthier and happier, which is why many legislators and cities are reducing automobile use.

Beijing, China, is the most polluted city in the world according to Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune in 2014. source 2 paragraph 14 This is due to the fact that being's automobile use is extremely high. When the city of Paris was faced with a similar crisis, it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their licence plate number, or they would face a fine. source 2 paragraph 1019. This revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in Paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day. The drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not advantageous. Cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times in 2009 source 1 paragraph 5, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels, thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use.

Although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier, evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier. Rosenthal writes about the city of Vauban, Germany, where ""70% of vaughn's families do not own a car."" source 1 paragraph 3 Heidrum Walter, a carless citizen from Vauban, states that, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" source 1 paragraph 3 The concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in Bogota, Columbia, where, according to Andrew Selsky of the Seattle Times in 2002, ""For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million."" source 3 paragraph 21 Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""as he rode his bike with his wife. The statements from Walter of Vauban and Plaza of Bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall wellbeing and happiness of people, thus we should limit our automotive use.

Limiting automobile use is so beneficial, that many groups and legislators are supporting a society with less cars. The EPA in the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act. source 1 paragraph 9 David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, states that, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociology proffesor at Drecel University, Mimi Sheller, further elaborates, stating, ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift."" source 4 paragraph 35 The support for a ""car reduced"" society by the US government and the EPA is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less, thus we should limit our automobile use.

Society is changing. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. source 4 paragraph 41 Now is the time to turn off the engine, get out of the car, and take a bus, bike, or train to work. By limiting our automobile use, we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels, and we are happier and healthier, which is why organizations like the EPA support the reduction of car use. We need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction. The benefits of reducing car use are countless, which explains why we should limit our automobile use."
07433107,1,"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.The Senate would choose the vicepresident. Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke."
85726ac5,0,"Cars may be a good source of travel, but, unknown to some, are dangerous to Earth and it's inhabitants. Limiting car usage to bicycles, walking, or any other option is a good idea. The reasons for this being that it makes traffic safer and, more importantly, reduces pollution.

To begin with, limiting use on cars makes traffic less of a hassle. For example, in the text, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" the author of this source reports that the effects of not using cars is, ""leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Source 3 Selsky Notice how, even in a big city, the effects of not using cars are extremely noticeable. If that carfree day makes it to EVERYWHERE in the planet, no more trafficrelated nonsense will occur. Furthermore, in the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" a citizen by the name of Heidrun Walter states ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" Source 1 Rosenthal Even she finds that the lack of a car makes life easier for her. This statement, though some would prefer not to admit that they were tense drivers, is true, as being behind the wheel in a large amount of traffic could be stressful. It is agreeable that the effects of not using cars shows how much better life would be if they were removed permanently.

In addition to reducing traffic, limiting the use of cars could decrease the amount of pollution. To illustrate, in the excerpt, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer reports that, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Source 2 Duffer It is shocking that the amount of driving in that city caused so much pollution that they needed to enforce a law banning driving, a TEMPORARY law. It is baffling how Paris didn't keep that law intact. To add insult to injury, according to ""The End of Car Culture,"" Obama plans to curve the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, seein how ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" Source 4 Rosenthal Wow, driving causes such a large amount of emissions to the point that it is near the amount of power plant emissions. It seems rather unbelievable, and some would wish that the article wasn't true, but the use of cars is practically killing humanity. The point is that car usage is damaging Earth and preventing use would reduce the damage.

To wrap things up, reducing car usage would make traffic less of a risk and decrease pollution. Perhaps it will make the planet a better place, or fail in the end and continue to hurt the land some would call ""home"". Just remember this, when you continue to use whatever car you use, remember the dangers it may bring."
3fa4498e,1,"Dear state senator, There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electorsal college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this argument, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. I believe the electorsal college should be taken away from the process. This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electorss. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation.

In the first place, the electorsal college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. The electorsal college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. Each state is given a certain number of electorss to represent its population Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have less electorss than California. It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is... In one way, though rare, the electorss may switch outlook, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented.

Not only does it have the unfair use of electorss, but it also is much more imprecise than popular voting methods. While the electorsal college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In ' The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electorsal vote, that ""the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country.

In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electorsal college votes, as such in the case of Nixon is Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate lose because of the electorsal college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electorsal college, didnt get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electorsal college is an unjust way to elect presidents.

I hope this is enough to change your view on the electorsal college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an electors can. Don't allow this to happen the next term. And i speak for most of the people in the U.S."
5418f03d,1,"I believe that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or opposite party. Also the problem comes up that the candidates do no go to there state thus never seeing them.

To began with I believe we should remove the Electoral Colleges. For the reason that voter are not voting but for a slate of electors. Who then elect the president, for example ""if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.""qoute form source 2 Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. ""Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" qoute form source 2. So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, ""and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Also another reason why we should remove the Electoral Colleges is for the reason that voters may become confuse and vote for the wrong person.

furthermore we should remove the Electors Colleges, because its unfair to the voters. For example the winner takes all system in each state. Candidates don't spend times in the states they know they have no chance winning. ""It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" qoute from source 3. But then what happens to the people in that wants to vote for them but can't because there votes go toward a slate of electors that votes for the other party. They focus on the swing states mostly. For Instance a Presidential race that happen were the electoral votes caused a certain party to win was. In 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Hore received more in dividual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. The electoral votes need to be removed because it causes problems in elections which makes any side able to win even though they don't have more individual votes. Another example is ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast on him."" qoute from sorce 3. Study shows that 60% of voters would prefer a direct election rather then what they have now.

On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states. If you elect a good representive that you believe, and trust that will vote to your liking. Someone that would not turn his back on the will of the people then it would not be that bad. The process they go throught maybe difficult and hard to understand. So it could be a good thing they take the hard work off our backs and do it for us to save us the time and hardwork. The Electoral Colleges requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal rather then a single region appeal.

To conclude I believe that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or opposite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."
f50c4179,0,"Limiting car usage comes with benefits for everything. It benefits the environment, yourself, and everyone else in the world.

If you use your car less or just use it when you need it, the amount of pollutants in the air from vehicle transportation would drop drastically. Vehicles are the second leading cause of pollution in the world behind factories. Cars are responsible for up to fifty percent of gas emissions in heavy traffic areas in the United States according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"". It is a very simple concept, cars produce gas emission, and using your car less can help protect the environment from pollutants.

The environment is not the only thing benefitted from limited car usage. You become healthier if you choose to totally lose the vehicle. Heidrun Walter stated ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage can also limit stress in a person. Besides being stress free, if you choose to walk to where you need to go, you exercise and do not realize it. Basically, if you want to lower your stress, not be tense, or be healthier, just limit your car usage and walk or ride a bicycle.

Vehicle accidents are a major cause of death in the world. So, if you decide to not use your car as much and just walk or bike, that is one less driver on the road. If the trend of limiting car usage and walking or biking spreads, the threats on the roadways will lower drastically. So in turn, using your car less can help keep everyone safe and help lower the amount of vehicle accidents and save lives.

With more people on the side walks, and less people behind the wheel, everyone can be benefitted. From stress to gas emission, everything can be solved with limiting your car usage."
341bd6dd,1,"Dear State Senate, The Electoral College is insane. There should not be an Electoral College, the vote should be by popular vote for the presidents. People feel less important when they know that there vote does not go to the entire 538 votes. If you are in a democratic state, like Texas, but are republican, then your vote is not going to matter because the votes are just going to go to the democratic president. When looking back in 2000, Gore had more popular votes, yet he lost the election because of the Electoral College. Thats insane that he lost, because more people wanted him to be presidents, yet that is not how the Electoral College works.

With the swing states, they can really hurt one of the presidents. Lets say Florida, for example, is very close in which president is going to be voted for. That is 29 votes just from that state! If you eliminate the Electoral College, it will be more balanced and that will not make or break one of the presidents. The presidents do not bother with the states that they know they are going to lose, and they do not even visit those states. If we eliminate the Electoral College, then everyone will get to hear from the presidents, and that could give them several extra thousand votes.

Also, the less populated states, like Wisconsin with only 3 votes, feel like they are not important toward the overall votes. If there was no Electoral College, then there 500,000 votes would be a huge boost toward either president. When voting for president, the voters do not even vote for the president! They vote for the state of electors who vote for the president. Who knows if the electors will lie and represent the Democrats or Republicans and then vote for the other side.

Finally, I leave you with my last reason of why we should get rid of the Electoral College. More people in the United States want a popular vote instead. Even Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole think we should. 60% of the United States would prefer a direct election!!! That is a direct message to you that we need to get rid of the Electoral College and start using a popular vote!

I hope you consider these changes to the voting system, as I have listed some of the best reasons. The majority of the country would like to see these changes take affect, not just me. I appreciate the consideration, thank you."
c7f747cb,1,"Dear State Senator , I wrote this letter to you to talk about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. My opinion on this intriguing subject is that we should keep the Electoral college , my reasons being that voting by a popular vote can sometimes go wrong and we avoid the RunOff Elections. When its time to pick a new president very few people research about this president and his slate of electors , they just vote for the most appalling to them , the one that is always out and doing meetings, or brunches , or just having a perfect day with their family. People that research or dig deep to find out who they are really voting for.

Let me start by saying that the ones whom created the Electoral College , where our founding fathers , these men are thought as wise and caring for their country. The reason stated why the Electoral College should be kept because popular voting can go wrong. Yes the popular vote of the Electoral College its worth but maybe not that much. In Defense of the Electoral College : Five reasons to keep our depised method of choosing the President , it states that "" But each party...win the national popular vote""source 3. Posner is stating that each party picks their electors to be trustworthy , not someone who would do dirty work behind their backs. People go out and vote for our next president and see them running our country , but sometimes people vote for a president for the reasons being that they just want to vote. Its not like the lines outside are not long enough for a person to just go into the voting booth and pick a random president and just leave. People dont actually look behind, search for whom they are voting for.Thats why the Electoral College shouldn be ruled out , the Electoral College is actually helping out more then we thought. When we least expect it we have a crazy wako running our country , then that would be the time when the people would Notice that they made a huge mistake.

RunOff elections , sounds like a tedious process. When RunOff elections occur some people get annoyed , why its a longer process. We get a little bit delayed on finding out on whom the president of the United States is going to be. People want to know who going to be the next president of their country , whos going to try to fix the small little problems the last president left. THose are mainly alll the questions these voters ask. In The Indefensible Electoral College :Why Even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford states "" At the most basic level...in the ""swing"" states"" source 2. Bradford claims that the candidates dont spend much time in states that they know wont get plenty of votes. Well true but why would they both of theses candidates are running for president they need to get as many votes they can if they are bad or good. Even though we are technically not being fair with theses states why because the candidiates arent paying so much of the their attention and aren't caring for those states votes. This country runs off on what the people want but sometimes are the people being fair?.

Keeping the Electoral College can be a really good thing do to the fact there are people that do know about choosing a president.It's been stated before that some people dont care at all who the next president is, as lonmg as they fix their problems and they have jobs, and good medicare they are perfectly fine who the president is. The Electoral College is like a helping hand."
b825ae1c,1,"The electoral college is one of the most heavily criticized institutions in the American government system. It has been considered outdated and antidemocratic. However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college. This leaves the smaller states existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people.

As it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. If just over half of the Californian voters vote for one candidate that they think would represent their interests, the map in source 3 shows that all 55 electors will present their votes to the college. It is better for California to be represented in this way so that the Californian economy would not be adversely effected by their minority voters. That sort of united front is beneficial to every state in the union, for the same reason.

The argument that the electoral college discourages voters of the minority party to vote is a valid criticism, but it is a problem that can be solved without the loss of the electoral college. Compulsory voting would be far more effective if voter turnout is an issue. People who would not have voted otherwise would still likely vote for the candidate they supported if voting was made mandatory.

In source 2, Bradford Plumer expressed dissatisfaction with the way political campaigns involving the electoral college focus on swing states rather than allowing equal debate in all states, but that does not make for a less desirable outcome. Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed.

The electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college."
648e4235,1,"For the vote for the president of the United States, the election should not depend on popular vote, but for the Electoral College. The citizens of the United States should understand that when they vote, they are voting for the Electoral College, and that their vote will not necessarily determine who the president is. The Electoral College should be picked more carefully to avoid ""the disaster factor"", but not completely abolished.

As stated in paragraph 1, the electoral college is a compromise between the congress and popular vote. This can serve as a check that determines the president. Just like children are taught in elementary school about science projects, multiple tests can determine the best result. Relying on one voting could put the wrong president in place, and our country is at stake in this situation. If the president presents his campaign to multiple groups of people, it can show what people want in many scenarios. This can determine what the best choice really is.

In paragraph 9 of source 2, it states how many presidents have wanted to abolish the electoral college. It seems that they all could have one thing in common: they recieve the popular vote, but not the Electoral College vote. I could frankly say that this makes them sound like sore losers, and because one of two parties didn't vote in their favor, they want to get rid of it. I'm sure they might have some legitimate reasons as to why they want to abolish the Electoral College, but I wouldn't doubt that being a sore loser is one of them.

In paragraph 11, the author talks about the 2000 fiasco. Although he makes some good points about the legitimacy of the Electoral College, some points can be made about the popular vote as well. Many people in the popular vote can choose their vote based on things that don't relate to the campaign, and some people running for president depend on it. They will spend their time trashing the opposing candidate which will cause the voter to think ""This president says that the other is bad and I believe them, so i will vote on the person that told me so"". This is just one example of how just like the Electoral College, the popular vote can be illegitimate as well.

Although there are many reasonable reasons to abolish the Electoral College, it should not be abolished so that the vote is based on many trials, rather than just 1. We should carefully select our Electoral College, but getting rid of it could put the wrong president in place for the wrong reasons. This is why the Electoral College should continue to be a part in the vote for the president of the United States."
2f216503,0,"There has beeon a major awareoness of the effects that cars have oon us as a meaons of traonsportatioon. People questioon whether or onot abaondooniong cars as our primary use of traonsportatioon is worth the health of the eonviroonmeont. The simple aonswer to that is obvious, there would be ono awareoness, ono statistics, ono movemeonts to preveont the use of cars, if there wereon't aony issue with them. Elimionationg cars as our primary source of traonsportatioon is almost impossible, meaoniong that the solutioon to this fossil fuel emissioon problem must be aon alteronative source of eonergy. As techonology has advaonced, so has the miondset the majority of the moderon society's populatioon towards the issues of cars. Has the miondset of the populatioon surpassed the advaoncemeont of techonology, or have we beeon igonoriong the fact that these fossil fuels emissioons have beeon detrimeontal to our eonviroonmeont.

The oone major thiong that has caught everyoone's atteontioon is that the health of our eonviroonmeont beiong onegatively impacted by the use of cars everyday. This is because this is the problem that should catch everyoone's atteontioon. People have this false onotioon that we woont see aony eonviroonmeontal chaonges ion our lifetime, so this meaons we doont have to worry about this onow. The problems that we predicted would occur have beeon occurriong over the past few years. A prime example of this would be ion Paris. Paris had beeon experieonciong some weather problems. There was aon abuondaonce of smog that was filliong the air, aond diesel fuel was blamed. Paris eonforced a partial driviong baon as a solutioon to the smog problem. By elimionationg cars as a use of traonsportatioon, some questioons may occur. How will exteronal delivery compaonies be able to deliver. By onot beiong able to deliver, these compaonies will lose reveonue, due to the fact that Paris has a partial baon oon driviong. Sionce this is most likely temporary, aond a ""partial"" baon, this problem may be elimionated from the coons list of implemeontiong this regulatioon. But a correlatioon occurred. After the partial baon of driviong, the smog disappeared. This shows that by elimionationg cars as a use of traonsportatioon this would have a sigonificaont effect oon our harmed eonviroonmeont.

Aonother fallacy that the majority of the populatioon has is that the oonly problem faciong the use of cars as the moderon society's primary source of traonsportatioon is that cars harm the eonviroonmeont. Eveon though this is the problem that we all oneed to face onow, there are other tedious thiongs that come with the adoptioon of cars. Bogota, Columbia, has had extreme coongestioon, has created a movemeont that has beeon so successful it has spread to other couontries. This movemeont ionvolves the populatioon abaondooniong their cars for oone day aond usiong aony other possible meaons of traonsportatioon. This movemeont eoncourages the elimionatioon of cars, physical fitoness, aond the elimionatioon of traffic jams. The populatioon of Bogota is so dedicated to this movemeont, that they have participated on this movemeont through bad weather coonditioons. This movemeont treats itself like a fuondameontal holiday to have every year. ""It' s a good oppurtuonity to take away stress aond lower air pollutioon."" Carlos Arturo Plaza participaont of the movemeont.

As you caon see the process of elimionationg cars as our primary source of traonsportatioon is a very difficult thiong to accomplish. Bogota, Columbia's movemeont to abaondoon cars for oone day is the closest the moderon society has gotteon to this. For this reasoon, there should be aon alteronate source of eonergy cars should ruon off of. By the eonviroonmeontal issues faciong the use of cars, there have beeon maony other problems that have sprouted because of the awareoness that the moderon society's citizeon has onow. Through the support of cars as the primary source of the moderon populatioon's traonsportatioon, there has beeon aon abuondaonce of users of cars. Sionce there was aon overproductioons of cars, seeiong how this is the primary source of traonspotatioon, statistics have occurred showiong the true daongers of the effects that the overuse of cars has oon our eonviroonmeont. By implemetiong aon alteronate source of eonergy that is onot harmful to the eonviroonmeont, this would fix the majority of the problems. Ionstead we have beeon focusiong oon selfdriviong cars ionstead of cars that will be able to sustsaion our eonviroonmeont before it's too late. A poteontial solutioon is eonergy efficieoncy, but the onumber oone solutioon is awareoness. Eoncouragiong awareoness is the oone thiong that caon produce more poteontial solutioons."
d1e52301,0,"The modern car is a major travel source in which millions of people rely on daily. The issue with this is the struggle of being stopped at lights or being in a traffic jam. The quintessential point here is that greenhouse gases will be lowered in mass amounts if we limit our car usage. Varying countries are supportive of having car free environmentsareas. Some being Germany, France, Columbia, and the U.S.

Elisabeth Rosenthal describes a community in Germany. Each owner of a house in the neighborhood is allowed to own a car but has to pay a fee of 40,000 to receive a spot. In this neighborhood of Vauban, there is no need for a car because stores are located next to the neighborhood which is ""Placed a walk away"" and is very efficient. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe..."" Vauban is in an attempt to lower these numbers because the thought of owning a car here is ""frowned upon"" because all essential stores are in walking distance.

The city of Paris was suffering from a smog epidemic and had to enforce a no driving ban. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" The French people that were usually driving were not here, so roads and major highways freed up which allows for more free room. The smog also was depleting due to a decrease of car usage.

Columbia is using a yearly plan for a carfree day which brings open streets to the city of Bogota. The advantage of this limited car usage is the promotion of alternate transportation and reduction of smog. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source three. When it comes to mind, driving can make a day more stressful which hinders work performance. The outstanding responses from this event brought ""Two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar..."" into the event. ""Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city..."" The community of Bogota took a chance to bring their lives closer by incorporating new businesses into a walkable distance from neighborhoods.

According to research, ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by..."" this also provides less Greenhouse gas effects on the environment. A main factor in reducing traffic jamsgreenhouse gases is the new plans that bring hope to those who are skeptical about switching over to carfree. ""New york's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls..."" Biking is an excellent alternative to driving because it is fast and efficient. Another plan was provided by the Moblie World Congress, ""Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical..."" As stated, big motor vehicle companies are trying to reduce the practicality of owning a car as soociety turns its head towards a carfree environment.

Cars are a very fast port of transportation but carry a burden of bad factors. Pollution has increased over the times in which cars have been overused and is the leading cause for an increase in Greenhouse gases. If we limit our car usage, we can create an almost free pollution zone and free up much needed space for other activites than miles upon miles of driving roads."
7e1c0cbd,0,"Many people wonder whether or not cars should be ban to help save the environment. They dont know if that would help us or make matters worse. Their are many advantages to not using cars. Some people just can't seem to let go of their cars. They need a push to get started and to stop using their cars every single day.

Their are multiple advantages to the banning of cars. One example would be getting rid of air pollution. Most air pollution is caused by cars so if you get rid of cars you will also get rid of air pollution. Air pollution can cause a lot of different problems it can cause people to get sick or many other things, so getting rid of it completely could help a lot of people.

Another thing people wouldn't have to worry about would be traffic jams on the way to work. During the week some many people are trying to get to and from work at the same time it causes a traffic jam. People are often late to work because of this reason. So putting a ban on cars could help out with that. People could walk to and from work or ride a bike. This would limit the number of traffic jams and people wouldn't have to worry about being late to work.

If people walked everywhere instead of drove everywhere people would be getting a lot of exercise and that could help too. Cars make us seem lazy where we drive everywhere we want to go but if we walk or rode a bike that could help out in many ways. Walking could get things off your mind you could walk with a friend that way you can hangout and talk about things while you walk. Walking could relieve stress. It could calm you down and just make you relax for a few and forget about all your problems.

Putting a ban on cars could also help the town in which you live in, not only by limiting air pollution but it could boost town activity. New restaurants would be built, and more places to shop. People would spend money on other things besides gas for their cars. Town businesses would do better and make more money, also new businesses could form.

Also getting rid of cars could limit the amount of deaths every year. Many deaths every year come from car accidents, drunk drivers, people not paying attention and many other things. If everyone walked or rode bikes to the places they wanted to go that could get rid of many deaths that happen every single day. That would make the world safer in so many ways.

Getting rid of cars and not depending on cars for everything could be what this worlds needs to improve itself. This could take us one step closer to living longer, happier, and healthy lives. People wouldn't have to worry about getting a car or paying insurance on a car. People wouldn't have to worry about getting their kids license, teaching them how to drive or anything like that. The number of deaths each year could go down and things could change for the better."
2ffc8b8f,1,"Dear state senator, The Electoral College that was established by the founding fathers in the constitution is important to all of us. Every candidate that is running for President in each state has its own group of electors that the political party of the candidate chose. I am however, not in favor of keeping the Electoral College but to change it to be an election by popular vote for the president of the United States, the reason being that it is unfair to the voters and outdated.

The Electoral College is unfair to it's voters. If the candidate has more electoral votes than popular votes then they have a higher chance of winning. ""Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" Plumer, Paragraph 9. The president is the leader of the United States and if most of our country votes on a candidate they think suites the best but the other candidate wins, that would make many voters dissapointed. ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"" Plumer, Paragraph 13. Every vote counts, and the candidate that gets the most popular votes deserves the win.

Since our founding fathers established the Electoral College it shows that it is outdated. ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer, Paragraph 14. This is the twentyfirst century, and we need to make our elections more modernized to where every voter is happy. A voter should not vote for an elector and hope that the candidate wins but be able to vote for the candidate itself. Even though there are many people against the Electoral College, it still has its defenders. ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency"" Plumer, Paragraph 9. As there are people who believe that whatever our founding fathers established we need to keep our tradition going and not change a single thing, but maybe it's time for a change. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than poeple who thing that single vote may decide an election"" Posner, Paragraph 23.

""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college"" Plumer, Paragraph 14! The voters think the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. People vote for a candidate but the outcome is not what they were expecting."
f75aa25f,0,"From Monster trucks to Volkswagen Beetles, all automobiles are created to make life easier for people from all corners of the Earth. Many people start up their cars everyday without a second thought, whether trekking across the street or across the country. Others believe that cars are ruining the Earth, and put effort toward decreasing their car's ""footprint"" on the environment. People everywhere should consider limiting their car usage.

A community with less cars has proven to also be one with less healthy citizens. According to Source Two, Paris, a city known for it's aromatic scents, was covered with the smell and appearance of smog for days they had nearrecord pollution: Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. After a day in which all evennumbered license plates were banned from the streets of Paris, the smog cleared up a great amount enough for the city officials to take the ban they had placed for odd numbered license plates the next day. The smog that was affecting the wellbeing of Paris' citizens had mostly disappeared after only one day of limited car use. If a community limits cars, its inhabitants will be almost forced to exercise more. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, where a ""Day Without Cars"" is held yearly, 118 miles of bike paths have been constructed, the most of any Latin American city. Less cars on the road in this city have led to other means of transportation being more popular, including walking and bicycling. These ways of getting around are much more healthy then their gaspowered alternative. Less traffic on roads will therefore leave cities healthier than otherwise.

There are many more reasons why citizens should limit their personal car use. Owning a car is huge investment. You have to pay for gas and oil refills for any standard car based on how much it is driven. Because of this, limiting car use would also limit the pressure on car owner's wallets. According to Source One, the majority of residents of Vauban, Germany don't have cars. This city is an example of a worldwide effort to make suburbs denser. Because of this there is no need for automobiles to commute across the city. The purchase of a car, which costs thousands to even millions of American dollars for the average buyer, is unecesssary for the residents of this town and therefore can lead to better financial stability.

Cardriving, the catalyst to the wonders of travel, will continue to drive on the pollution of our Earth. Babysitters, doctors, students, and even the retired will thrive from limitations of car usage. Whether by limiting car usage or not, Earth's inhabitants need to ensure their planet is treated right."
2c760000,0,"""My fellow americans,"" a phrase said by many important people, like current president Barack Obama, implicates that the speaker is trying to portray a message. So I use that phrase for a reason, ""My fellow americans, there has been a current movement to limit the amount of time a person spends driving."" There are many advantages to limiting car use, that could make a big difference in the amount of greenhouse gases.

Take Vauban, Germany for example, a neighborhood where 70 percent of its residents do not own a car. This neighborhood follows a growing trend across the world, and is flourishing. Source 1 states, ""In the United States, the environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously."" This statement is a perfect example of this growing trend. If many suburbs follow vaughn's example, then the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere will plummet. This will then cause the ozone to repair itself and global warming can be stopped. Source 1 also states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" This statistic is shocking! If the United States is responsible for a majority of the greenhouse emissions, then why has the United states done nothing to fix this. This is not the only example of this growing trend.

Another example is Paris in 2014. Due to the abundance of smog in the air, Paris banned driving cars for a limited amount of time. This fixed their problem, but Paris removed the ban after only one week. Source 2 states, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Why would France stop the solution to their smog problem. The answer is, loss of revenue. Many companies during this ban lost revenue due to not being able to deliver their goods. Source 2 also states, ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe."" This is a key factor in France's smog problem, and could be stopped by making a law limiting car usage.

One influential example is Bogota, Columbia. The citizens of Bogota have a tradition called ""the Day Without Cars."" They have been honoring this tradition for three years straight, and other countries around them are starting to take notice of its effects. Source 3 states, ""For the first time, two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event."" This statement shows how much of a pressing matter smog is to normal ppeople around the world. Source 3 also states, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" A day without cars not only helps the enviroment, it also mentally helps a person. If this could lower stress world wide, then less people would suffer from stress related injuries. Source 3 states, ""... and new restaurantsd and upscale shopping districts have croped up."" This tradition also helps the economy and can lower the percentage of people under the poverty line by creating jobs and helping people start their own business.

Three examples of cities or countries that have, at one time, stopped the usage of cars were shown in this essay. If all of the benefits from limting car use, like strengthening the economy, are true, then why has the world not caught on to this idea and helped it flourish. This essay has shown the benefits of limiting car use, but it is up to you to make a difference."
eaddf4b3,0,"Car usage is decreasing all over the world quickly. Many people see that needing a car is no longer a priority to them anymore. Many communities are eliminating cars in the neighborhood. And in certain areas of Germany, people are not even allowed to have cars. They sell them to live in the neighborhoods.

To begin with, limiting car usage is eliminating air pollution in Bejing, and Paris and in the United States. In Paris, there has been heavy air smog and if ur caught driving in the streets you get fined 22euros 31. Thousands of people were fined according to the international news agency headquarters in London for driving there cars during the smog. Twenty seven27 people had there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine they were given. Because of the air smog in Paris, people were not allowed to drive anywhere they had to take the public transit to get to their destination. So reducing the car use in Paris help get rid of the smog faster.

Also, another reason eliminating car usage is an advantage is less traffic backups. In Bogota, Colombia the citizens hiked,biked,skated andor took the public buses to work which left the street empty of traffic jams. Since the mid1990s, the city has had ""A Day without cars"" campaign. Over time, the city has seen over 118 miles of bicycle paths being created and most of Latin American cities. Parks and sports centers also have grown throughout the cities. The sidewalks been replaced by smoother ones, traffic jams have had a dramatic drop and also more restraints and upscale shopping centers were built. So after all, eliminating cars is not a bad thing.

In addition to, every year in the United States more and more people been buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as each ongoing year goes by. So the question that reaks through everyones mind,""Has America passed the peak driving?"" Well, we may not know that answer for sure but what we do know is there is alot of changes going on. Now we all know this country was the birth place for the very first Model T Ford, and where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally."" We all have love affairs with cars in this country, but over the past year our love affairs have cooled down some. Statistics show that between 2001 and 2009, driving by young people decreased by 23 percent23%. But when this generation ""grows up"" will the car rates start going back up because the parents have to take their children to soccer practice, school plays? This will remain an open question until that time. As of recently the number of miles driven per person has dropped nearly 9 percent9% below the peak and the same rate as it was in January of 1995. Part of this explaination is because people were unemployed and could not afford new cars.

According to Mimi Sheller, different things are converging. For example, she stated that the internet makes telecommunicating possible and easiar and makes peolpe feel more connected to others without driving around.

To conclude, there are a plethora of advantages of why limiting car usage is a great benefit to everyone and even the environment! The air pollution will be cut down by a major percent."
4d9aba3b,0,"Many people in the world today are quite desperate to see change in their life. They are seeking a better life, something new and fun, and to do it for cheap. Walking or riding bike is the cleanest way to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There's no cost to walk, you just do it. It's something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not emmiting forom your body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will nt only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.

Accidents would be almost nonexistent if we were to gert rid of motherized vehicles. In the article, ""in German suburb, life goes on without cars"" the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The way the Germans started to remove cars forom the road is by removing parking lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and they are so inconvient.

Any doctor in the world no matter how young, or where they live will tell their patients that exercise is the only way to stay healthy, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting forom one place to another will require another means for transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride your bike. It's cheap and effective not only for you but the environment.

Fuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone layer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesnt take fuel. Just good old man power. It's tragic in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", ""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue."" this world is what we are leaving our children and their children to live in. Make sure you leave it better than when you came.

In the four articles they all talk about the negative in driving rather than the positive. The reason is because there are more negatives to the industrialization of a car rather than just going back to the way our ancestors used to be. Even our young as our vary own parents are amazed at how much damage this generation is doing to themselves and everything around them. It is the result of inventions like the automobile. Vehicles are efficient in some way, but you might prefer to take a bit more time here and there to allow that you can be there when your children have children."
186231b2,1,"Dear Senator, The topic of the Electoral college is a hot one, and the idea of whether of not to adjust it is controversial. Many citizen disagree with the process while many are in favor. What should we do? We should change the Electoral College. The voting is based more on quantity instead of quality, and the voting is not coming from the citizen's directly, making the risk of an unfaithful candidate too high and the actual voting less popular and more electoral. When one stateor even one person could change the whole ball game that is the Presidential Election, then what does that mean for our democracy?

While many will argue that it is a fair way to vote, the Electoral College has many flaws. First off, the candidates are focusing on more power and higher tallying states to get them through the election than everyone as a whole. For example, if you were a presidential candidate would you spend more time trying to sway California, with its whopping 55 electoral votes, or montana, with a teeny tiny 3 electoral votes? The candidates are not being considerate of ALL the American citizens, but instead the ones that they think will lead them to victory. This is not what the election is all about. The election is more focused on the popular vote of few states with many inhabitants than it is on many states with few citizens.

""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" As stated in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" . Being that this true, why do we call it the ""Presidential Election"" instead of the ""Electors Election?"" Electors claim to be faithful to their candidates but sometimes this is not the case. If a member of the group is unfaithful to their candidate, it could unsettle the whole election, meaning that the United States as a whole would have to pay for the electors actions. This is not how voting was meant to be. Our slogan is ""We the People,"" not ""We the Electors."" Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years."" In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregationan established rule and law was not questioned. Or even if the settlers of the United States had not questioned our former mother country and broke away. We would not even be the establishment we are today if we did not question established rules or traditions. The Electoral College is nothing more than a system that needs to be reevaluated, putting the popularity if the candidate in clearer perspective.

To recap, The Electoral College does not include the popularity of the candidates over official influences. The states are not being counted equally and electors control the electon overall. In order to have a more successful government and a more included population, the Electoral College simply needs to be reevaluated and changed to meet the popularity standards of our country if we are to ever advance."
67fe0236,1,"They should change to election by popular vote. The people have a right to decide so shouldn't they. We elect electors and not the president that's not right. They electors have changed the votes around. The electoral college should go. Athough there is a positive look to it.

Letting the people vote is the right thing. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.""Bradford Plumer. So the poeple dont truely decide who becomes president. At least not if we choose the electors and the electors choose the president. The voting system needs to change.

Who's to say that the electors dont change the votes around. ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.""Bradford Plumer. So is that possible. The people of the United States don't have control over the electors except the fact that they choose them. The electors could totally go against the people even though, say one person may have had more votes against this other person. Then the electors liked the person who was losing so the choose that person anyway. Who's to say that they havent done it before. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888."" So this did accure twice.

""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""Ofiice of the Federal Register. So it does have a positive side to it. It's a good thing to have to keep the power balanced through out the voting process. So having the Electoral College may not truely be a bad idea. Although there will always be that inbetween group known as the electors.

So they should still change the Electoral College over to elections by the people. The voting system needs fixing. The elceltors have chance the vote twice who's to say they won't do it again. The Electoral College can be good at some aspects. Still the power should always remain with the people and that's how it should be."
25c0ca47,0,"America's love of cars may soon be spiraling down. With America's car culture seemingly coming to an end, there will be more alternative ways to get to work, school, shopping districts, and etc. As the years come and go by quickly, Americans are buying less cars and obtaining fewer licenses for themselves. The advantages we can receive by limiting our car usage is that it takes away stress, lowers air pollution, and benefits daily businesses.

First, Limiting car usage takes away stress. As businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states:""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" People who no longer own a car will not have to worry as much about their car. Such as the price of gas rising, car payments, and insurance payments. These type of payments every month often put a big dent in a person's wallet. If we take up to the opportunity of limiting our car usage, we really won't have to worry about car payments anymore. Plus, being outside in the environment will certainly reduce stress levels almost completely, because we are interacting with others that are walking and enjoying the the environment outside.

In addition to, taking away stress. Limiting car usage will result in lower air pollution. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" If we limit car usage, the levels of air pollution will dramatically decrease resulting in cleaner air and a healthy environment for us to live in. If we continue to use cars, we are further damaging the air that we breathe everyday and causing people to damage their lungs. Pollution often has chemicals that can harm our breathing and sometimes our lungs. As Americans it is our responsibility to take care of the earth and we are not doing so by constantly using our cars.

Lastly, limiting car usage benefits daily businesses. Selsky staes: ""Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. If we rely on walking to stores, etc. that are only a block away, it will surely increase the revenue of restaurants and shopping districts. Since the stores are so close to home, we'll be more willing to enter the store andor restaurant. Increasing businesses revenue also helps the economy, which we desperately need.

In conclusion, these advantages that we have gone over in the essay will greatly impact the future of America. Such as, taking away stress from former car owners, lowering the air pollution so we have a cleaner air to breathe, and beneifiting our daily businesses to increase revenue and better our economy. If we all limit car usage and follow the advantages listed, it will result in a better earth for us to live in."
b76c7cde,0,"In today's society, when people are asked if they would give up their cars, they would be shocked. No would be the most common answer. However, the advantages of limiting car usage are great. General stress decreases, and pollution to the environment also decreases. People are not only helping themselves, but also helping the ecosystem.

Stress. Everyone has it but what if it could be decreased just by using personal transportation less? In Germany, there are certain communities that ban car usage. No cars are allowed inside the city. Street parking, driveways, and home garages have become obsolete. One citizen of one of the towns said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" . The anxiety one gets when driving a car is almost unreal. Most kids 16 and up now just do not get their licenses just because the thought of driving scares them. Citizens of cities that have just one day where cares are prohibited, such as Bogota, Colombia, love that singular day out of the year. Most say its a good opportunity to increase mental health Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota . Stress not only is awful for mental health, but also physical. 75% of those who have high levels of anxiety, or are exposed to it, are tired all the time, often feel weak, or sometimes may even cause heart issues. The number one reason people have stress is by driving. So using cars less is the best way to decrease stress, and promote good mental health.

Most people that read or watch the news know that the environment is hurt, and that the human population is at fault. How? Excess usage of motor vehicles. As stated in In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States. These statistics are horrible. Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of nearrecord pollution rates Not only was nature being hurt, but the population of France. Breathing in smog is unnatural. theman body can not take that many pollutants, and so it tries to fix itself. In doing this, lung cancer rates rise, pneumonia rates rise, diseases in general become more abundant. Paris took action. When enforcing the driving ban, congestion was down 60% in just five days. The only partial solution to this rising amount of smog is to decrease driving rates, and to use deisel gas less. I hate this test so much why am I even writing this I feel like a robot just going through the motions and its your fault. I blame you.

Rome was not built in a day, so getting state legislatiors or even government officials to agree on a partial driving rule may take a while. However, citizens can spread the word of the evils of driving. You, dear reader, can fix this problem. Try carpooling to work, riding your bike to places near you instead of driving. Do what you can to reduce pollution and stress. Influence your friends and family to do the same. Together, we can rase awareness of the evils of driving. Together, we can rule the world."
efde5095,0,"We, the people of the United States, live in a car happy society. Every teenager can't wait until their 16th birthday because, for mostly every kid, that means that they go get their drivers license and possibly their very own car. Also, adults always look at getting a nice luxurious car and the top make and model of that year. Well, without a shadow of doubt, we should adopt the plan to cut down our usage of cars. It seems very successful considering 70% of vaughn's families don't own cars. It is detrimental to our country.

In case you haven't noticed lately but there is lot of pollution in the air.

According to article 1 , anywhere up to 50 percent of carintensive areas in the US make up the greenhouse gas emissions. It is depressing seeing all of this smog and pollution in the air everyday. Just a little heads up but the pollution increases every single day we use cars. It is a shame seeing such an extravogant and extraordinary country go to crap due to pollution. If you want to see how every state is going to look if we keep relying on cars then go to California and see how much of an eye sore it is. Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and pollution. Polution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.

People today care lot about making and having lot of benjamins . Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all of the things you would't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even car pool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.

Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen everyday and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is really scary and nerveracking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the gruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would of been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.

Without question it is neccesary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our pollution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little bit and see what the result is. Atleast once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well thought out and it will definetly show improvements that we want to see. So lets do it and see how much it affects our country."
0cfc3580,1,"Dear State Senator, most people in theis country may argue theat the Electoral College is well layed out system in which according to source 3: In Defense of thee Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised metheod of choosing a president ""The winnertakeall metheod of awarding electoral votes induces candidates to focus theeir campaign efforts on thee tossup states"", which means presidents are always looking for support from small states, which is based on population, to be voted for because in thee big states little to no votes are accepted by thee Electoral College. I disagree, I believe theat theis metheod is wrong and unfair for thee peope so I argue against it.

To begin withe, according to source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even thee bestlaid defenses of thee system are wrong ""At thee most basic level, thee electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of thee winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states theey know theey have no chance of winning, focusing only on thee tight races on thee ""swing"" states"", theis means theat in some states one candidate might have a better chance of winning thean thee otheer candidate and even theough a candidate is at disadvantage because thee otheer takes all thee votes because of thee electoral college theat candidate might win and thee people of theat state will not even know who is theis winning candidate until theey see him on tv as an actual president, which probably means theat thee winning candidate won't help theat state because he does not know well enough about it. Additionally, according to source 3 ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as rodney ws in thee Southe, has no incentive to campaign heavily in theose states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plularity in states theat he knows he will win"", theis means theat in order to win thee presidency a candidate must get to know otheer regions but because in theis case Mitt rodney vs. Barrack Obama, Obama was thee regional favorite for thee Northe rodney was at a disadvantage, which is what thee Electoral College ultimately wants.

To conclude withe, I theink theat thee metheod of using thee Electoral College to elect presidents is wrong and unfair. Furtheermore, according to source 2 ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdate, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions witheout much basis in reality"" theis means theat thee electoral college is just not fit for thee modern democrat world of today and mostly people argue against it."
c74af9cf,0,"""Life goes on without cars.""Rosenthal.There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Two advantages to limiting car usage is it reducees smog and it helps with greenhouse gas emission.

To start of with limiting car usage helps with the reducetion of smog. To illustrate,in the text ""Paris bans driving due to smog""Duffer the city of Paris decides to put a ban on driving:""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31.The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day.""Duffer 10. This ban was put to good use by some but others still did not follow with the ban about 4,000 people were fined. People will still find away to break a ban or regulation that is put out. This just shows how many motorists are actually out on the streets of Paris but still a good number of people went through with the ban. Many people did participate inthis ban,it helps reducee the smog that is desperately needed in this city. To further illustrate , in the text ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hot in Bogota."" Selsky. Bogota, Columbia decides to put into place a carfree day to ""reducee smog. Violators faced 25 fines.""Selsky 21. Also like the ban in Paris this ban was put out to help with the cities problem with smog. In a capital city of over 7 million and people trying to get to work and on with there day of course there would be a problem with smog. The smog can cause many problems with the environment and health of the people in that community,especially in a city with a hot climate like Colombia. Also two other cities joined in this car free day: Cali and Valledupar. In both of these stories the ban limit on the usage of cars is for the one problem that many big cities face like Paris, booga , Beijing and many more:smog.

To continue , limiting car usage also helps with greenhouse gas emission. For example, in the text ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""Rosenthal one of the reasons that Vauban, Germany decided to become a carfree suburb "" is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission from tailpipe...""Rosenthal 5. ""Passenger Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe""Rosenthal 5 by having this city in Germany go carfree its going to help that 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisssion go down. Also, with that many cars in Vauban the environment is healthier which makes the people in that city healthier more stress free. Another example is in the text "" the End of Car Culture.""Rosenthal. With less Americans buying cars and driving less "" President Obamas ambitious goals to curb the greenhouse gas emission""Rosenthal 29 is beginning to happen. The greenhouse gas emission will be reaching a decline with the miles that people are driving going down. If the driving rates continue to go down and Obamas goal to reducee the greenhouse gas emission in the U.S. will go down and the country would not be responsible for up to 50 percent greenhouse gas emission in some parts of heavily populated car areas in the United States. Limiting the usage of cars can help with greenhouse gas emission.

In conclusion, There are many advantages to limiting the usage of cars. Two advantages to limiting the usage of cars is it reducees smog and it helps with greenhouse gas emission. Having a limit on car usage helps with the well being a the community."
63a4f67c,0,"Cars are a major aspect of transportation in the twentyfirst century. Having the hottest, newest, model of vehicle is all the craze in todays carloving society. But new research shows that cars are becoming a leading contributor to the pollution of major cities world wide, and cities all across the globe are doing whatever they can to help prevent the pollution.

Eupore has always fancied its luxurious cars, especially in upscale communities. But in recent years countries such as germany and France have made efforts to reduce the amount of cars on the streets in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the air. A new upscale community in Vauban, Germany has been built completely on the basis of no cars. Seventy percent of the residents of this community do not own cars, and those who do own cars, must keep them outside of the community. Many residents here feel that having no cars gives them a little peace of mind. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" A major upside to not owning a car is the relief from stress. Many people have many worries about their cars whether it will work, the amount of gas in it, the cost of gas, and so on. Getting rid of the problem also gets rid of the worry. Getting rid of cars also allows new opportunities for better city building. making cities and suburbs denser discourages the need for cars and promotes the idea of walking, biking, or skating to a destination.

The United States has always loved its cars, but recently many people have taken to the sidewalks instead of taking to the streets. Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in America and it seems to be declining. studies find that after 2005, many Americans began to stop buysing cars and started to find other ways to go from point A to point B. Many people credit this fact to the recession around 2008. After the down turn, people became more money contious, and the unemployed didn't need to go anywhere anyway. With no cars, Americans can save thousands of dollars a year because of no payments and not having to pay those expensive gas prices! The fewer cars on the street has also had a positive impact on the environment. Less greenhouse gases has made the air in the suburbs and some cities much cleaner. Technology has also made a huge impact on our commute. People connected with friends and family without even having to drive and visit them, and teleconfernces across countries and continents have reduced the need to drive or fly places to do buisness. Many mojor car producig companies have also rebranded themselves in order to make personal transportation a thing of the past and make mass public transportation a obtainable goal.

Smog is a big issue, not only in the United States, but also in places such as Erope and Latin America, both of which have started to make efforts on cleaning the air and redcing the amount of cars on the road. In the 1990's Bogota, Colombia started a tradition in which the citizens find alternative ways of trasportation to work and shops one day out of the year, and for three straight years, cars have been banned in the streets on this ""holiday."" Because this event has grown so poular, many people have started to practice life without cars on a daily basis. New parks have formed, hundreds of biking paths have been added throughout the city, and upscale resturants and stores have began to pop up in the city. The carfree lifestyle has definitely effected Bogota, Colombia. Europe has also had a great quarrel with its smog problem in recent years, and Frane has been making an effort to stop the smog problem from getting any bigger. Paris recently put a ban on driving in the city in effort to reduce smog. On Monday, divers with even license plates were asked to find other ways of transportation, and on Tuesday drivers with odd license plates could not drive. The population did not have a very positive reaction, but the congestion of cars in the capital did go down sixty percent on both days, and the efforts worked so well, the city was able to lift the ban after on week.

Car culture has been a part of our societ for a long time. However, large strides have been made all across the globe in order to reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of pollution in the air. These strides have had many positive impacts on the communities they have served in and continute to make tomorrow a better and cleaner world."
8a53964d,1,"After reading a few articles explaining the Electoral College system and reading arguments for and against it, I have decided the system is not worth keeping in place. The system does not take every voter into account, and our electors are not always reliable. Also, this system of voting can discourage citizens in nonswing states from voting, which may be it's greatest crime. The Electoral College is worn out and ready for retirement.

The Electoral College, although seemingly based on the people's votes, is really dependent on whoever the chosen electors want as president. It does not seem very fair for voters to spend months listening to drawn out debates, campaign commercials, and becoming educated on the candidates, just to have their vote essentially thrown away if they did not vote for the majority. No, they do not even get to see their vote in action. It is simply erased and given to a slate of electors who stand for the majority of the state, even if the majority is only 50.1%. To the new generation of voters who really want to make a difference in the government, the idea that unless we pick the right candidate for our state, our votes really do not matter is absurd.

In the electoral college system, even the majority voters in each state can not count on having reliable electors, according to Bradford Plumer, the author of an antiElectoral Collegearticle. Electors can be anyone who does not hold a public office, and these people can be swayed or loyal to their own party as well Plumer. These are the people our votes are really going towards, not the actual president as many uneducated could be led to believe. Although the trust of these people is rarely misplaced Richard A. Posner, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our present method of choosing the President, there is always a possibility of the electors being swayed at the last minute, which is a bit of a scary thought. Imagine if segregationists in the louisiana legislature had succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, one of or best presidents Plumer.

The final reason keeping the Electoral College system in place is a bad idea is that if you are a voter in a clearly defined state, that is, nonswing, you are more likley to decide not to vote at all. When candidates can clearly define states in which they know they will win, or have no hope of winning, they don't bother spending time there to educate voters. Voters in these states do not get all the information they might want in order to make an educated decision. This would lead to a biased, uneducated state in which voters don't care to vote because of a mindset that almost everyone in the state is of a certain political mindset and their vote is just another piece of paper that will not matter. These voters could also make rash decisions because they did not get to truly hear all of the campaignes. In swing states where there is not a clearly defined political opinion, voters will be bombarded with information, and although they may be educated and well versed in their opinions, the votes, no matter how close, will not really matter because of the nature of the Electoral College system.

In closing, the Electoral College system is not worth saving. Although some may argue it gives a certainity of outcome or restores the balance to heavily populated states Posner, it does not give everyone's vote a fair chance. Nor does it guarantee the electors will be reliable. The Electoral College system even dissuades voters from excercising their Constitutional right to vote. Please take this into consideration, Mr. Senator, next time the Electoral College comes into question. Thank you for recieveing my most humble opinion."
e8a65671,0,"Living in a polluted world were you cannot see the sun is not ideal, most of pollution comes from car emissions. We as people today cannot imagine what it would be like without a car, but there are advantages of not having one. There is a city in VAUBAN, Germany that residents have given up cars.

At first glance this experimental town might seem to be completly outrageous, but it works very well,this community has 5,500 residents. Without a car life would seem to be a lot harder, moving around would require effort, but towns like this one have all the shopping and parks within walking distance of your home. Stores arent spread out,so it doesn't take a 15 minute drive get to the store, but only a 5 minute walk. A resident of the town said that "" When i had a car i was always tense""s1p3. To me this means that the resident no longer had to worry about getting into a car and worry about getting into a accident, all they have to worry about is catching the bus.

Car congestion is the worst when you are trying to get to home or to work, in the big capitals around the world they have banned driving for certain people nonspecific day every week. Paris is a example of one of these countries, if you were caught you had to pay a 31 dollar fine. After 5 days congestion was down 60%. ""According to the BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday""s2p18. Other countries are doing this as well, In BOGOTA, Columbia they have a program called ""A Day Without Cars"". In this program all cars a banned, the only way to get around is with taxis and buses, people who dont agree have to pay a 25 dollar fine."" It's a good opportunity to take away stress said Carlos Plaza""s3p24. From this event many countries have come to observe to take the idea and apply in their country, also parks and sporting center have popped up because the people are more active.

Having a car isn't all it is cracked up to be , owning cars and getting licenses have decreased in the past years. This is because people are finding better ways to get around without harming the enviornment. Paris,France had smog so bad that it rivaled Beijing, Chinia, but with the legislation and cooperation of the public they were able the get the smog to go down. There are many advantages of not having a car, you can relax and destress, help the enviorment , and be able to see the sun during the day due to car emissions going down to almost nonexistent."
c8c72ecb,1,"When you vote for president you want to vote for who you choose. Thats not how it always works though. We you vote for president you are actually voting for a candidate who will then go and vote for president. Is that really fair? Many people dont think so. The electoral college should be abolished because it isnt always fair, who cant be sure if your voting right and it is not democracy.

When you vote for a candidate you trust they will vote for who they say they will. but is it always true? what is the candidate feels like they dont agree with that person any more and vote for a different one? You and everybody else who voted for that canadaite are now voting for an opposing candidate. is that fair to who ever voted for that candidate now?

You can never be sure if you are voting right. what if that candidate dose not vote like they are supposed too. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" says Plumer about the chance a candidate will vote for someone else. You can never really trust someone you have never met. Humans are very despitefully creatures, we all lie and decive. how can you trust a random canadite just because he says he or she will vote for who you want to vote for? wouldnt you rather vote yourself?

Democracy is giving people the rigth to help govern there own country. Isnt the electoral collage taking that right away? Even though this is in the Constitution it is unconstitutional. ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to all voters."" says Plumer. He is correct about the electoral college and its unfairness to US citizens.

The electoral colleage may have had a good reasson for existing when they made the constution but that was about a 100 years ago... Dont you think we have chaged since then? The anwser is we have and so should they way our goverment works. If we keep the same goverment into the future where everything will change we will be in for a load of trouble."
d804d5a7,1,"Dear State Senator, ""The Electoral college is a process not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" I do not thing think this is the best method of voting on the next President for our Country. I feel this way because the people of America do not really make the decision of who becomes President their vote just goes to a slate of electors. People may say that the Electoral College is fair but some of the biggest states only vote on democratic or republican candidates and thats not fair at all.

The first reason I think the Electoral college should be abolished is because the deciding factor of who becomes Americas President doesn't come from the people it comes from the Electoral college. Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for the President but for a slate of electors. The election process should be changed to ""election by popular vote."" Another reason I think we shouldn't use the electoral college is because some states are biased towards certain political groups so say California wanted a democrat to be President that person would receive 55 electoral votes from just one state! Many states that don't have as many electoral votes may not even get to see the candidates because they only care about the larger states. For instance, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The third reason I think we should let the outcome be decided by the American people and not electoral colleges is because the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California."
0a13d187,0,"Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportation? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable resources. The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communities, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communities, and more beneficial ways of transportation. Once you go green you will go never back.

To start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get trapped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certain days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.

In addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.

Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bikesharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.

To summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation."
5d63fe39,1,"When were voting for president were not technically voting for the president in fact we are voting for the slate of electors. The electors can be anyone without a public holding office. Electoral college process is not a good process for presidency. While a president can get the majority of the popular vote on the other hand, he could have the minority of the electoral college votes. That president would lose the election even though he technically had the most votes. We should change the process into popular votes for the president.

The electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. The article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election.

The electoral college is a unfair process because of the winnertakeall system. In the article called What Is The Electoral College"", by the office of the federal register it quoted most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.

In conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winnertakes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean votes that'll actually be fair for once."
6ad38694,1,"Electoral College?

Dear state senator, i been reading all these arguments on whether we should keep the Electoral College or not. My opinion is, that we should most definitely keep it. We can avoid run off elections, there could be a great outcome, although we dont pick who gets to be president, we're still picking so people can elect that one president. But that's just my opinion. So please read on and just look into it.

Mr. Senator sir, did you know that in ""1968 the election of nixon and in 1992 the election of Clinton both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively. That's pressure for a run off elections... when no candidate wins a majority of that votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which on the other hand if they had gone with the Electoral College that would have invariably produced a clear winner"" I read that off of an article. Now that sounds pretty reasonable to me Senator sir. You wouldn't want to complicate an election just because of something little would you now? American population did vote in 2012's election but voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference than the people who think that a single vote of theirs might decide an election. Think about that sir.

Don't you ever think to compare what the outcomes would be if we voted a certain way? Well if you went with the Electoral College you would have a certainty of an outcome senator, like for example in 2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Almost all the states award the electoral votes on a winner takes all. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans regional appeal. Whoever wins the election its going to be everyone's president so why not pick the best guy for the job. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance in that large states by population.

Although we might not particularly be voting for the presidents but for the people who vote for him we are techanically still voting for him thats just one of the cons about this. That's why people are arguing in the first place, some people know that we don't vote for the president himself just the people he chose to elect him. Other people think that yeah we do vote for him that they want other people to know that they're a republican and what not , but that isnt the point. The point is that we need someone good enough to run our country! Not just to show that theyre republicans or democrats.

That is my opinion on which process to go on for electing president. you might get other people's opinion but I think its better if we just use the Electoral College process. It wont complicate things for you or anyone else. It is a clearer way of showing who has one the election and who hasn't. This process would make life way easier , and it won't waste more time that shouldnt be wasted! So Mr. Senator sir, look into that process."
e6083fb1,1,"The Electoral College was created by our Founding Fathers. They put this in the Constitution to make electing the President of the United States fair and equal to all the citizens in the United States. The Electoral College should not be changed no matter what. To go against the Constitution would be to go against the nation, for we were built on the leadership of our Founding Fathers and the guidance of the Constitution. This Contitstution was created so that the people have more power than the government. So I strongly believe that the Electoral College should stay the same. It is the government that needs to change. There is nothing wrong with the Electoral College, it is just the ones that run it. So if there should be any change, it should be the government that should change, not the Electoral College!

The pectoral College is a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and by the popular vote of the citizens. When the voting starts the electors come to a meeting place and vote on who they want as President. After the meeting, there has to be a majority of two hundred seventy electoral votes for the election of the president. The electoral College is as I have said it before is fair and equal to all the citizens in the United States. To take this away now would be a catastrophe, because that would mean that all the other presidents in the past would not have even been our Presidents, the history behind them would be rubbish and not even true. Some states may have a ""winnertakeall"" sort of thing but they are together and voting together as on state. Some of them may vote for the other one but the majority of them is for one person. Some of the states believe that it is not even worth it to have a ""winnertakeall"", because they think it is unfair. Then after the presidential election comes the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which is a list of all those who ran for President and there respective electors.

The electoral college has been around ever since the Constitution was created. It may be unfair now, but if there would have been any changes to the Constitution it would have been done then instead of now. The Electoral College was probably a great idea when the the Constitution fisrt started out. Then the years have gone by and now we want change. Well I see that the Electoral College can be unfair but it is also fair in it's own right. Because of the fiasco in the year of two thousand about the abolishment of the Electoral College, it has left a scare in our nation about the government, because you guys are giving out the information on the candidates to late or not at all. That SUCKS, for most states because they may not even get one advertisment about the candidates any where or even a commercial on T.V. If the vote for the abolishment of the Electoral College does happen, then there is nothing that I can do about it, but you can still change your ways. You can make it fair and not irrational. Even send the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" earlier than you have done before now. This is a nation of freedom and peace, how are you trying to keep the peace with other countries if you can not even keep the peace within your own?

The government is the real problem, not the Electoral College. It may be unfair, because the majority of the people may have chosen one person while the electors may choose the other. Then when they add it together it is there vote that counts more than the peoples. If the government had only done the right thing and elected what the people wanted, then no one would have a problem with the Electoral College. It is stupid that the government is listening to what we have to say but not hearing it completly. The Constitution is a document of equality for the people. Not the government. If our nations democracy is a democracy then they should listen more to what the people have to say and not what the government has to say. If the government would do this then things would run more smoothly within our country and there would be less conflict.

This nation is a nation of freedom and peace. Not for a bunch of people who are power hungry. The Electoral College is fair and equal, it is the government that is not. If the government would only change for the better then there would be no problem. This nation is still young compared to all the other countries. They have gotten all there issues taken care of, but we have not. The reason is that some of the officials are power hungry and do things to take care of themselves and not others, but some are not and they want to make this country better. Those are the ones that should stay and not the power hungry ones. They make it fair. So I strongly belive that the Electoral College should stay the same, and that the government should be the one to change."
8525c905,1,"Dear Senator, People have different opinions on the Electoral College. Some feel that it should be changed, and the president should be elected by popular vote. To explain what the Electoral College is, the Office of the Federal Register writes What is the Electoral College?.

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, to explain the problems with the Electoral College, and lastly, Richard A. Posner writes In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President to explain why we should keep the Electoral College. It has been made clear that we should not change the Electoral College.

It is true that the Electoral College may be confusing Plumer, but it has worked for all these years, thus we should just leave it the way it is.

To start, The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress, and it also considers the popular vote of qualified citizens Office of the Federal Register. The founding fathers wanted us to use this system. They knew it would succeed.

Next, Plumer writes, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair..."" This is not true because the number of electorals each state gets is always decided by the number of members that state has in the House of Representatives, plus two for the senators Office of the Federal Register.

Additionally, Richard A. Posner says that ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree all are pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. He then goes on and says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" In the Electoral College system, their will always be a certainty of outcome. Plumer goes against that and writes, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This cannot happen. Posner also writes that ""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" The north, for example, does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president Posner. The president is everyone's president.

Also, The Electoral College considers swing states and big states. Plumer writes ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"". This is not true because of the idea of swing states and big states. Swing States, also known as tossup states, are the states that pretty much decide the election. They could go either way Posner. ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senete decreed in the Constitution. "" This means that the larger the state in population, not size, the more their overall vote weighs.

Lastly, by using the Electoral College, we are avoiding RunOff Elections. A run off election is when no candidate recieves a majority Posner.

In conclusion, you and I both know the Electoral College has some flaws, but overall, it makes sense to keep it the way it is.

Yours truly, Emily."
8ff3c55e,1,"The senate should remove the Electoral college and make the popular vote system the main way on deciding who's president. The electorsal college seem's to have many flaw's that can make voting a disaster. Voter's aren't truely voting for a president, they vote for a slate of candidates who then vote for president.

The worst part about this type of voting is the disaster factor sourse 2:paragraph 11. It clearly says "" segragationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeede in replacing the democratic electorss with new electorss who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This shows that the results of an electorsal college can sometimes not be decided by the people, but mostly on the electorss of each state. People say the the electorsal college is an easier,cleaner, and faster method, but when it comes for the people to vote for president The electorsal college system wont suit what the people mainly would like.

The electorsal college is an unfair way to vote for president, During the 2000 caspian program, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.sourse 2: paragraph 13. These things shows that the candidates dont care about having the smaller states votes, but wants bigger populated states like california and texas. This is often called a "" Winnertakeall"" system since it each state doesn't get to see what there electors is really all about. Also it can show that with the electorsal college, electorss can vote for a president who is regionally favorable and not nationaly. This can often make the voters feel less satisfied with thier president since there president might not show interest in there opinions.

The Electoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which there is little to no popular votes what so ever. Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral College sourse 3: paragraph 22.This goes to show that the Peoples votes dont usually matter when it comes to voting for a president but the electorss do.

Once agian,The senate should remove the Electoral college and make the popular vote system the main way of deciding who's president. This will be benifitial to many states that want to be involved in the election but feel that there saying in things wouldn't matter."
3d5340bc,0,"All arround the world countries are making an effort to reduce their use of cars to benefit the Earth. There are many benefits to reducing car usage all arround the world. Not only does it reduce pollution but it also promotes getting out and being active. Vauban, Germany is a carfree community where the voices of a few children can drown out the hum of a car. Bogota, Colombia has established a program called the Day Without Cars where they promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. This promotes people to use transportation that runs on manpower like bikes or even walking. This also falls into the fact that as people use bikes and walk they begin to get more exercize. Although most of the time it is more continent to use cars to get to a location some places have stores within walking distance so there would be no need for the use of a car.

Pollution has been a problem arround the world for many years, each country is responsible for their own share of polluting the Earth and cars are part of the problem. Cars alone are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse emissions in America, if Americans made an effort to reduce that number by just half it would mean a world of difference to that country. It would result in America being less responsible for the pollution of the Earth and a safer environment for the citizens. However, other countries have been taking action to help the environment, efforts were thrown towards cities to make it more beneficial to walk and they are now setting their sights on suburbs. Vauban, Germany is acommunity where there is an advanced experiment that focuses on eliminating the use of cars. Their efforts have proven quite successful as only 30 percent of the families that live there own cars and almost 60 percent of the residents sold their car in order to live there. Bogota, Colombia has created a day where everyone is encouraged to use bikes and walk instead of using fuelburning cars, those who chose not to participate in this event were fined 25. The effort that was put into the making of thisevent has inspired other countries like Cali and Valledupar to do the same. This shows that people are making an effort to move torards environmentally beneficial habits that cause a chain reaction.

Another benefit to reducing the use of cars is that people will get more exercize than they usually do. For some people the most exercize they get is the walk from the couch to the fridge or the 30 minutes when they are at the mall. Unfortunatley, people do not walk arround the mall every day for their daily exercize routine. Decreasing the use of cars would promote people to use their physical energy in order to get to their desired destination. This would also result in having stores and other services of use closer by so people will be more willing to walk to them."
8dd606ef,1,"I would say that we keep the Electoral College because it has worked over the past century so why change it now. The people voting don't always know what they want in a president they might be undecided and just choose the best looking one. I mean yeah some have their facts straight and know how the president they are voting is going to help the united states become a better country overall. When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likely will vote for the candidate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants.

I mean we people are still voting we still have the vote just that our vote goes to choosing a certain elector instead of just directly leaving it to the people to vote for a certain candidate running for president. By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody heher is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.

This does make the candidate running for president try to convience the electors he is the one they need and that he will help our country be better. This also helps the candidate running for president know what states he should go to since some states they already know they lost. It stated in the article that ""A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.""So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for.

I think the Electoral college is great and well organized the process is good and the only thing is does is make the voting process more easier and ordered. I think we should keep it i mean it has had his troubles her and there but it has worked so good for such a long time. We don't want to change it and create choas since a lot of people are not use to change and don't take it quite well. I hope this is the way we keep on voting i think its great and that changing it would just make things harder on everybody."
607520b5,1,"In the United States we have been voting for president for many decades. But now there are protest against the process of electing a president. Many argue that the electoral college should be abolished and others feel that we should elect by popular vote. I strongly believe that we should change to popular vote because the electors could defy peoples will, they are unfair to voters, and people arent necessarily voting for their president.

To begin with, the electors have the power to defy peoples will. State legislators are responsible for picking electors and those electors can defy the will of people. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding for whomever they please."" said Bradford Plumer.This is not right because the legislatures are picking electors that are using their powers for the worst.

Next,the electoral college is unfair to the voters. "" Because of the winnertakesall system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" said Plumer. For example , during the 2000 campaign only 17 states didnt see the candidates all, that includes Rhode Island and South Carolina. Electoral colleges are not being fair to the states and their voters.

Lastly, the election process should be changed to popular vote because voters are necessarily voting for the president. Most people think that when they go to vote for their president that their votes are what decides the final outcome, but thats not true!.Its the electoral college that decides that. Some people dont vote for that reason , because they dont think that their vote will change anything. And in the end it does not seem very fair that are votes count by very little.

In conclusion, the way we elect are president every four years should be changed. It should go based on popular vote not on electoral college because elector could defy people, they are unfair to voters , and people arent necessarily voting for their president. For all the reason people should be able to vote and they will know that their vote will be counted."
d1737074,0,"In America, cars have been an integral part of our culture from the Model T. Ford to the Mustang cars have cemented themselves into our mindset. But currently cars are starting to cause a lot of problems to people such as: car accidents, pollution, and just leaving areas to crowdy. One of the main problems that cars globally cause is smog emission which is caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and can cause difficulty in breathing, lung cancer and rampant air pollution. However, in other parts of the world people are limiting car usage to almost banning them all out completly in certain areas in order to be more environmentally friendly and reducing air pollution. By limiting car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

In North America, pollution has been a major problem for citizens in many ways. Besides power plants, the second main source of pollution are cars, as they release harmful chemicals and gases like smog which can cause congestion and when too much and inhaled on a daily basis, can lead to lung cancer. By limiting car usage people can benefit more to the people for example in Paris,France a partial driving ban was enforced in order to clear the air of smog after days of nearrecord pollution. By doing this congestion was brought down by 60 percent helping to majorly clear the air and make breathing better for people.

In Vauban, Germany residents of the area have been called suburban pioneers due to giving up their cars. By doing this people were able to be more happy and enjoy life more. For example, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" this aids the argument that by banning or limiting car usage people are able to be much calmer and benefit more. In Bogota, Colombia during ""Carfree day"" for the first time two colombian cities joined Bogota in this unique event. there more parks and sports centers for people were placed, the sidewalk were smoothe and more business and commercial areas were opened up for people. This further shows that people can benfit greatly without having cars.

Throughout the world wherever cars have been limited or banned there has always been one constant, new alternative transportation. In China in order to help reduce the absurd amount of smog and air pollution, chinese citizens resorted to using bikes leading to a drop in smog levels. By limiting cars and replacing them with alternative transportation people can be much safer from more dangerous situations, such as car acsidents hurting people, keeping dunk drivers away from the steering wheel, and being able to save more money from not buying a car. Though some alternate vehicles are not fast enoguh for example bikes, this has been remedied in some areas by allowing free public transit from buses and taxi services.

Throughout all of these benfits people can benfit more greatly but that's not enough. In 2012 during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford proposed a business plan in where partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation trafic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Through bright ideas like the advantages of limiting cars can be fully realized and brought to life in order to help and save more people from negative aftereffects. In America if people were to cut down on car use people could benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars."

If that state has more votes for one candidate than the other then that state votes for that for that candidate as a whole. If the person I vote for doesn't get the vote for my state then that defeats the purpose of me voting. The electoral college takes away my say in choosing a president, the fairness, and it might have been put in the Constitution by the founding fathers but it is outdated.

The first reason why the electoral college shouldn't be used is because it takes away voters say in the decision for the president. If I vote for someone and the state doesnt pick him, that would mean my vote didn't count. That means i would now mean no one would even care about my vote. My vote wont even help make it a closer race. It's like my vote just vanishes into the air and is never seen again. If there are millions in the country and only 538 votes count. This is unrational to voters.

The second reason why the electoral college shouldn be used is because it isnt fair. It is especially unfair because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidates don't even waste time going to states they know they cant win but only focus on swing states, which for one takes away the privilege for the others that want to vote for the candidate to see them. It also takes away from the smaller states who don't get to put out as many votes as California with 55 or Florida with 29. Alot of states only have three votes and even though it could win or lose a races it still isn't fair to the people.

The electoral college was put into the Constitution by the founding fathers but they are not always right. The Constitution says all men are created equal but we still have had slavery. The Constitution has given us freedom of speech but once we step on school property that rule is taken away. The Constitution is not always the right way to go for everything. The founding fathers were very smart men but they have to think of how the country feels now because they were alive a long time ago.

In, conclusion the electoral college should just be put out of work because it is not the best way to elect a candidate, it takes away my say in the decision,the fairness, it was made by the great founding fathers but is outdated by how the counrty is now. Everyones vote should be out into play with the elections."
cc01c188,1,"I believe that we should change the system to ""election by popular vote"". If we were to change the way we elect our president im sure citizens would be more pleased with the over all outcome. People vote on who they think is best fit to represent them and give them the best over all outcome. When using the ""electoral college"" you are not voting for the president but you are voting for a state of electors. It would be easier to simply allow presidents to get the popular vote in order to make the election more fair all around. The ""electoral college"" is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system. It is time to change our voting methods because the ""electoral college"" system is outdated, irrational, and unfair to citizens.

When people place their vote they believe they are putting in a vote for the president they choose, not for a slate of electors. The ""electoral college"" is a very nondemocratic way of selecting your president. In a way the government is deceiving their citizens by the way our voting method is set up. When people vote they feel a sense of independence because they are allowed to choose who they would like to represent them in congress. But instead once they place their vote it goes to electors rather than a simple vote towards the one they selected. If you were to change the way people's votes were counted it would be easier and faster to elect a president and get him into office to fix worldwide problems.

In all three articles at least one section has made it clear on their opinion to abolish the electoral college. Figures such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have agreed on abolishing the electoral college. When voting for president you are voting for a slate of electors, but do we even know who these supposed electors are! Are votes are being manipulated and we are not even aware of who is doing it. If we can not vote for are president without going through electors we should be able to vote for the electors who are voting for are president. It is only fair that we have some say in everything that is going on. When votes are being placed we should be informed of all that is going on.

If you were to vote for your favorite to show but your vote had to go through twenty different people all with different opinions you would be frustrated. Now imagine that scenario but with something extremely more significant than a television show, the president. You are trusting possibly the next four years of your life with strangers in which you have never heard of before. It would only be fair if we could simply change the system to popular vote rather than electoral college.

If you switch to popular vote more people would be more likely to vote because they could have more confidence about their vote. They would feel free to make their own decision and trust it would not be tampered with by a stranger. People deserve a fair vote and with the popular vote that is what you are giving them. Because every living being deserves equality. Changing the system would not only be helpful for citizens but helpful for the congress. Instead of having random members of congress choose the president they can work on serious issues around the world. They can stop worrying about foolishness and do their jobs.

In conclusion changing the way people vote is easier for everybody. It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I believe that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with. So to end my argument I simply say think before you act and truly try to do whats right."
9d3a9a2c,0,"Cars are usually in most peoples every day lives. We drive them to work, school and many other purposes. Cars have been around for over one hundred years but are people really ready to limit car usage? In a lot of cases around the whole entire world the answer is yes. Their are many reasons to own an automobile, however their is a lot of reasons not to own an automobile as well.

A main topic now around the globe is the environment. Not all cars are going to kill the environment but if you put too many cars in one area it can weaken an environment, this is including cities. Cars can cause a substance called smog which is terrible for the environment or a local residence such as a city or town. As a matter of fact Paris as inforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog of its city. Beijing, China is probably one of smogs worst victims. It is known as one of the most polluted city in the entire world! Sadly, cars are a huge part of the creation of smog. Smog is horrifically bad for the environment for a huge reason, and that reason is not being able to breathe.

Cars take up a lot of space in towns and cities across the entire globe. These areas are packed with roads, that take up many space of the area. imagine what it would be like with no streets, turnpike, roads in general. If you did imagine a world without roads you would see nothing but fields, trees, wildlife of every sort. If not wildlife you would see uncrowned cities with buildings that are close and not so hard to get to. People are adopting this idea around the entire world. These cities are easy and very manageable to go through. The environment is unbelievably clean in these cities and make life in general less of a hastle. This may not be the way of the future but it is a great idea!

Every car has a bad side to them. Not on the car itself but what it can do to you. Cars make a lot of people angry. How do cars make people angry you might ask? Their is a thing in the car community called traffic. If you drive a car chances are you have been in traffic before. Traffic can cause anger which some people like to call road rage. Sadly a lot of people have lost their lives to road rage by getting into car accidents. Car accidents take the lives of many people in the world. A lot of things can take peoples lives but cars cause some of the most deaths in the world. It is not true that a world withot cars would be more safe but the fact is, cars can be a very dangerouse tool.

People use cars almost everywhere in this world but the question still remains, are people ready to limit car usage? Many people have their opinions about car usage and we may never know the answer to this question. If you think about it we have only been driving cars for a little over one hundred years. Us humans have been living on this earth for thousands of years and have been driving cars for only a little over one hundred. Cars are being more produced now than ever and I think will stay progressing for the future years to come. In reality most people need a car to live their lives. The way things are looking like now, chances are needing a car to live a normal life is going to progress in the folowing years of the future."
43edf702,1,"I think that the electoral votes should not decide who the president is. This is a nation where people have the right to vote, and the fact that the votes of the people don't even matter is not right. What is the point in even voting if our vote doesn't count, what is the point in the candidate giving speeches to the people if it's all just for nothing. The popular votes are the ones that should be counted towards who becomes the president. People all over the country are told to vote, or are guilted into voting becomes it's a right that we should be happy and proud to have but then the vote that we put on the ballot doesn't make a difference, it's the electoral votes that really matter. What makes them more important than us. The electoral votes are not democratic.

Yes the electoral college does somewhat balance out the big states from the little states based on population but that still doesn't matter. If over 50% of the United States votes for one person but then they lose to someone with a little more electoral college votes then are they really our president, we the people didn't vote for him so then why is he allowed to be our president. The founding fathers gave us the right to vote but the truth is that the vote isn't really real. I think we should just change it so that the people are the ones that get their votes counted because you can't tell us to go voted and then not even let it mean something. Being able to vote is one of the things that we have that most other countries don't have, but the reality is that our vote is disregarded and somebody else makes the vote for us.

Do you think that people are going to want to vote for someone if it is basically just a waste of time. If the votes actually counted I bet a lot more people would go to the polls. People would be more interested in the speeches and wanting to listen to their views if they knew that their vote was important to the candidate. In 2012 only about a half of the people who were eligible to vote didn't and that number could keep getting lower if we don't change it. The younger generation doesn't care right now because they already know that their vote doesn't matter.

The electoral votes only have five reasons as to why they should stay.

Incase of dispute over the outcome Everyone's president Requires candidate to have transregional appeal Winnertakeall method awarding electoral votes Balances the small states and the big states population Avoid runoff elections Avoids both candidates havingno majority The electoral votes don't seem to be very American. The whole electoral college system is confusing and as said in the passage ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. If we were to have a vote and the peoples votes actually counted that asked people if they want to keep the electoral college or get rid of it I bet over 50% of the people in this country would want to get rid of it."
9332774c,0,"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking concepts to the suburbs. Residents of an upscale community in Germany have given up their cars, generating a revolutionary change.

Limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" according to businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, a resident of Bogota, Columbia. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, but thanks to the partial driving ban, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. By reducing the amount of driving we do, we could decrease the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into our atmosphere, ultimately creating a greener, healthier environment for all of earths inhabitants.

An improvement in society is also being made due to the ambitious goals to decrease car usage. Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout cities uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The worlds love affair with vehicles seem to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly nine percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January of 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures, the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. If the pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.

""All of our development since World War Two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. By decreasing the amount of car usage, we could generate enough change to truly change the world."
f404cd3c,0,"Automobiles have been all anyone talks about since the 1950s. With the creation of the Model T, songs that were sung of cars like ""Mustang Sally"", and providing transportation to millions across the globe, how could they not be controversial?. But shortly after 2005, driving has not been the peak of transportation. Many countries are banning the use of motorvehicles for multiple reasons and it may not be such a bad thing.

Recently, countries have been asking their residents to either take a day or two off from driving or give up their cars overall. In Vauban, Germany, 70 percent of the families do not own a car but rather they walk or bike everywhere. Residents say they do not feel stressed out so often and are no longer tense as they were when having a car. In Bogota, the people feel the same way. The Colombian city has had a ""Day Without Cars"" event for three years and most people really enjoy the relaxation you get from not driving a car everywhere you go. More and more countries and cities are implementing this idea.

One of the major priorities right now is air pollution from gas emissions and that is why countries are slowing down motorvehicle usage. In Paris 147 micrograms of particulate matter were found, 114 in Brussels and almost 80 micrograms in London. Most of that is because of driving. With diesel fuel ranking over gasoline, we are not getting anywhere. Countries in Europe and South America have put in fines and days that people are not allowed to drive because of how bad the smog is getting in some of the areas.

The next thing countries are trying to do is increase the number of alternative transportation. How long has it been since you rode a bike? Or walked to the nearest grocery store? With the decreasing amount of people using their cars, the amount of people riding their bike or going for a walk is exploding upwards. Since the 1990s, Bogota has constructed 118 miles worth of bike paths. Sidewalks were made to a higher quality, the parks attendance rates have rapidly increased and the shopping centers are shaped up very nicely now. All because of a few days without driving.

It may seem like a burden or even a bad idea in general but if we cut down the number of motorvehicles, we can save a lot of the beautiful parts of in world and install some new ones while we're at it. The fuel is hurting the environment and everyone should help out."
a648260a,1,"Dear Florida state senator, In few words, the United States should keep the Electoral Collage. Although the people may not depend on them, it does not mean that they are dependable either. The United States may have a long process of voting for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people, but it still is being done for the good of the countries future.

The process for gaining a president may be long and not allow the peoples voices to matter, but the future of the country cannot be placed on their unreliable decisions. Not all of the people are experienced on the ways of the government as the Electoral College or the House of Representatives are. In truth, you may never know that if a certified member of any one of the states is actually on the side for the greater good of the country. An enemy country may pay for any large number of citizens to elect a certain candidate that could be working for them. This could happen with the Electoral Collage. They may be paid by an organization working against the U.S. or by one of the candidates themselves for personal gain. But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie. Source 3 states that there is an equal number of electors which gives every state a chance of getting in the matter of equally electing a candidate for president.

Many things could happen while there is a new president to be elected. As I said before: the Electoral College may be paid to pick one candidate for president over the other. Source 2, by Bradford Plumer, states that the Electoral College has its defenses. Some of its members may be replaced in a state for that states' personal gain in the matter. Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well!

All in all, it is very unreliable to put trust in the people, or anyone, for voting a president. Not many people may like the Electoral College, or their final decision, but even then it is the best way of getting a fair vote on a president. They will be there to select the new future of the country, besides being their job to do so, as opposed to the American people having duties elsewhere. They may want a candidate over the other, but even then by the end of the day, they would be in the same square they were on even before there was to be a new president elected. Even so, if there is a change in their style of living that they frown upon, they can always alert Congress."
16652a46,1,"The electoral college is a bad thing because voters aren't voting directly for the candidates. Voters are only voting for a slate of electors that then vote for a president. Uninformed people might be mislead as to what they are actually voting for. The election should be changed to popular vote because the electoral college is not voting directly on a matter.

While big states have more say in what happens, small states were created to have just as much power. There are few states with over twenty electoral votes, and twenty votes is a lot. But, there are far more small statesin terms of population than big states. Having many states with only 716 beats few big states with 2055. Some candidates won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote due to what states they were popular in. This sways the actual results of voting and messes up what should be based on raw voting numbers. Having electors making the desision for the state is another reason why certain candidates lose.

Some people in America don't know the difference between the popular vote and electoral vote. This can result in people being mislead. If a candidate were to visit California and make a good impression, that state would have a higher chance of being in that candidates favor. If another candidate were to go to Montana, make a good impression just like the first one, he would have the advantage for that state. Both candidates put in the same effort, but the first one would have many more electoral votes than the second mainly because of how electoral votes work.

The winner takes all rule is also in some way bad. Candidates would be competing over larger states like California and New York, If the voting within that state came down to a 49 to 51 percent vote, one candidate would be so close but acheive absoloutly nothing. Each candidate SHOULD get whatever votes they earned to make the voting the way it should be and more fair.

The electoral college is in many ways imperfect, which is why popular vote would be more efficient and more of an actual competition. Popular vote is also a way to make voting simple."
e1cf4688,1,"Should we keep the electoral college? No because when you vote for your candidate in the presidential election you are actually voting for hisher electors. Also because electors can be anyone not holdin up in the public office. Finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same candidate. Over 60 percent of todays voters would prefer a more direct way of electing our officials than how we are electing them now.

Did you know that when you vote for the candidate that you want to be elected into office you are not only voting for that candidate you are actually voting for that candidates electors? Under the electoral college system us voters dont vote for the president but we vote for a slate of electors which in turn elect the candidate we voted for. Say that you voted for Obama in last years election you didnt actually vote for Obama you voted for his electors to vote for im in turn of you voting for them. Many people see this to be fine but say that your candidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down a road of betrayl. This is one important reason for the electoral party to be disbanded.

Electors that represent a candidate in the presidential run can be anyone not holding public office. Who chooses for these electors? Not the voters of course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard of or seen in any flyers or ads. That state chooses their officials from state conventions,and even sometimes at the state partys committee or the president has his own party of electors for himself which would in a way be cheating by having your own officials vote for you.

What if the electoral party you voted for to vote for a specific candidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for a different xcandidate in the election? You cant always control the electors to stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group of voters who voted for a candidate would actually vote for the candidate that they actually want to win. Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the candidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that candidate. That the candidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different candidate that the ended up voting for during the election. This is why we dont need the electoral college to help vote for the presidents we should have a more direct way of voting."
a20be030,0,"Over the course of years new technologies have been invented to better our life style. there have been inventions like trains,airplanes and boats to better our transportion however there is one transportion vehicle that has spun up many controversies. The automobile or ""car"" as most people call it has spanwed more harm than good rates of pollution have risen and smog can be found almost anywhere. Limiting the usage of cars should a solution due to the advantage of reduced pollution, less green house gas and it could even make a person happier!

As most industrial inventions cars do produce tons of smog due to Diesel fuel a chemical found in cars. Smog has been such a issue that the city of paris actully had to enforce a law that would ban cars for a few days. This law was so stressed that any one caught driving would bee fined 22 euros in which converted in dollars would add up to 31 dollars. Paris had more smog than any other european capital they had about 147 micrograms compared to London on the other hand which only had 79.7. With such high numbers of micrograms the intensity of the smog worsend causing the extreme idea of banning cars. This example should be a reason on why we should reduce the usage of automobiles so that extreme measures are not acted on but more importantly the possibility of having pure of cleansed oxygen.

In alliance of having minimum pollution safety is also one advantage that reducing driving may enhance according too Bill Ford executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company stated that the plan of reducing usage of cars did bring a safer world for pedestrians not only does is bring about safety but it does conserve natural resources like oil that may take hundreds of years to replenish. We need to keep in mine that as inhabitants of earth we must care and value every natural resource. We only have one planet and we must protect it. Reducing driving has been such a triumph that a mother of two even said ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" once again this statement only poves that reducing the usage of automobiles is a better life style for all.

All in all reducing driving does bring some great advantages and should really be consider as a plan to make the world a better place. this plan should be acted upon all over the world."
63c502d2,0,"What's the first thing you think about when you see a car? How much gas mileage its has? What year is it? How fast can it go? Well, have you ever thought about how much pollution it puts into our air that we breathe? Or the car bill you have to pay every month?I'm going to assume you don't. There are ways we can change this problem and im going to prove how!

To begin this argument im going to point out that over 77% of American people are in debt in their car bill, ALONE. That's over 34 of our population in the U.S. You cannot tell me people are not stressed from this over whelming statement! ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."", said by a former car owner Heidrun Walter. She now rides bicycles with her two children and now acar bill is one less thing she has to worry about in her hectic life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be do reduce smog pollution. Now this is not only a problem in America, it's all over theworld. Paris is particularly bad in this division. Paris typically has more smog that other European capitals. It got so horrible they has to enforce a ""driving ban"" to ensure all the air was clear in the global city. It even rivaled Beijing, China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. After about five days the congestion on the streets plumitted down to 60%.

Having said that, not only is car usage bad for our earth, we could benefit our health from it! In Bogota, Columbia they set up a program named ""Car free day."" Millions of their citizens hiked, climbed, skated or took bus transportation to work. This day left the streets empty with no traffic, and the people that did drive had a 25 fine. Rain or shine nothing could stop these people from participating in this event. The city benefited from this so much that parks and sport centers have boomed from high demand because people want to have a healthier lifestyle in general. One day they hope every city has something similar to this day so that our owlrd will be heathier and even happier!

Therefor it is clearly obvious of the advantages we would have if we limited on car usage. People would be alot healthier not only from the excersise, but the air would be alot more cleaner to breathe in. Also it would be safer and cut down tremendously on deaths.We might just be over the peak of driving."
81acef36,0,"Many places around the world are limiting the usage of cars. If more places created regulations like these, it may drastically change the environment, for the better.

Vauban, a suburb in Germany, made conditions in the neighborhood almost impossible to own a car. While it may seem like an annoyance, many of the residents are happier this way. According to Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" While many people may see having to give up or not use their can an annoyance, if they get used to it they might find that not using their cars may be a good thing.

Instead of having to hear car engines and honking horns, they can take a relaxing walk or even a bike ride somewhere.

Limiting car usage would also be very helpful in cleaning up the environment. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" the author states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas in the United States."" Limiting the amount people can drive their cars could reduce a hefty amount of pollution in our air. In France, they limitied the amount of people who were allowed to drive for two days. Paris has more pollution in their air then most European cities, but putting regulations on who could drive significantly reduced the amount of smog in just a few days, according to Robert Duffer.

Putting regulations on car usage can also make the area you live in a much nicer place. In Colombia, a few cities have an annual ""Day Without Cars"", where citizens are fined for using their cars. As a result, things like restaurants and malls have been being built. They are repairing more sidewalks and building new bicycle paths. Parks are being used more often. The communities would be much nicer places with out the frequent use of cars.

Limiting the use of cars is a very good thing. It helps the environment, and it helps make the world a nicer place."
55c182da,1,"Dear Mr. Senator, We, the people of Florida are concerned about the Electoral College system. I am writing to you to explain our opinions on this way to elect our president. I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to choose the president of the United States because it lacks reasoning, it is unfair to voters, and disloyalty and mistakes can easily occur.

The Electoral College should be abolished due to the simple fact that many voters do not feel that is fair or have equality during the elections. In the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the Bestlaid Defenses of the System Are Wrong, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign."" Various people do not have any connection with the candidates that have a chance to be in control of the country they live in. The candidates only worry about the tossup states, because they know in the other states they have no chance of winning, which is not fair for some areas and should be changed. States are forgotten and not considered, which is unacceptable when they live in a place of equality.

The abolishment of the Electoral College should occur, because it is irrational and lacks correct organization. When a tie occurs in the electoral vote, the election is dependent on the House of Representatives, therefore the state delegations vote on the candidates. With this said, representatives of small populated areas would have the equality of representatives in over populated states that include thirtyfive million voters. In addition there has been accidents where a candidate has more popular votes than his opponent but fewer electoral votes, therefore he does not win. The numbers are not put into thought.

Unlike the popular votes, disloyalty is a large problem and a possibility of the Electoral College system. The people are not voting for the president, instead they are voting for a slate of electors, who supposedly elect the president. The process is very disorganized, because all the states choose the electors differently and have no control of whom they are voting for. In the article, In Defense of the Electoral College, it states, ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed."" Its advocates realize the misloyality yet they ignore it. With the Electoral College there are many possibilities that the president elected did not win fairly or without contributing to their success.

The Electoral College has been used for several years, but there is a need for change. Its advocates claim that mistakes rarely occur and should not be abolished for those reason, but I belive they should still be put in consideration and not be ignored."
829e720d,0,"Automobile accidents are very common in suburbs and in cities. Car reduced communities would not only help help us us a world financially but also help when it comes to our health. Robert Duffer and Elisabeth Rosenthal explain and inform the advantages of limiting car usage.

Cars in this day in age seem like a necessity when it comes to transportation but cars being the main source of transportation isn't always a good thing. Many countries are beginning to promote the philosophy of car reduced communities. According to David Goldberg, "" All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change "". Cars being the main focus of transportation is not good. The gases from the fuel produces pollution which eventually leads to harmful diseases. We should take more advantage of our technological advances and come up with a safer, effective, and more economical way to transport our everyday citizens. Imagine if we stopped using cars. The air we breath in day by day would be cleaner, we would all have more money, and their would be less automotive accidents day by day which is one of the main reasons are population isn't increasing as fast as it could. Smog is the main harmful effect of abusing our car usage. Source 2 states that "" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving bam to clear the air of the global city "". The city of Paris is probably one of the most visited city in the entire world so for them to have to stop car usage due to smog is a big deal. Studies have shown that cars are very dangerous and harmful yet we still drive them everyday unconcontious of the fact that day by day were slowly making it harder on ourselves as humans to even survive. Cars are the main source of transportation now a days but its clear to see that the use of cars opposes many disadvantages.

Carfree days would be very effective when it comes to the conservation of our people. bogota Colombia has come up with the idea of car free days but is this idea more effective them it is ineffective? According to Source 3 "" It was he third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of & million "". You can only imagine how positive this idea actually ended up being. Many people thought that it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Having many more of these days world wide wouldn't harm us unless we allow it to becasuse we've become so dependable on these machines but it would would help our planet become cleaner which tends to relieve stress. With the realization of the fact that cars are better helpful then they are harmful many people may stop buying cars. Source 4 claims that "" President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assist from an incepient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, drving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by "". Many citizens are beginnning to focus and understand that presrving our populaiton is more important then going where they want when they want to. The concept of carfree days seems to be the better route to choose when it comes to survival, living, and a stressless environment.

Automible accidents are becoming very common in surburbs and cities. We as a people need to more contious on healthier and cleaner communities so that we can begin to produce healthier children. Healthier children means focused children and citizens. Children that are focused on having goals and having careers that help our planet.

We should make the smarter decision to be less selfish and more selfless so we as a people should reduce car usage so we can continute to grow as a population, culltivate, and explore together."
ac83dc0a,1,"The Electoral College gives certain states, based on their popularity, a number of how many of what I guess can be called ""points"" that will go to to the candidate that gets the most votes for themself out of that state. Now whether that is a good idea or not is completely based on your own opion which you can decide. But I disagree with the Electoral College, even though it did take me a while of thinking I came to the conclusion that an all out popular vote is more efficient when it comes to voting for a president than the electoral college, and there is three main reasons that swung me to side with popular vote, First of all, when you get right down to it the Electoral College just doesnt give perfect accuracy on who does actually get the exact most votes. Some people cant completely grasp this fact but imagine that there is Florida, Alaska, and Montana. The first candidate, which we shall call John and the second, Bill, are going for these three states. John beats Bill on Florida 5,000 to 4,999 and John gets all 29 electoral votes because of that, tough luck for Bill. Luckily for Bill he sweeps over John in Alaska 100 to 0 and montana 100 0 and gets 3 points from each state which gives him 6 points total. So now by popular vote Bill would win with 5,199 votes against John's 5,000. But since Bill only has 6 Electoral points because he still lost Florida, which was the state John won and got a whopping 29 points from, Bill will lose his campaign to John 296 because thats what the amazing ""wonders"" of the Electoral College are. Which basically sums up how in 2000 Al Gore lost to Bill Gates even that Al Gore had more overall votes.

The Electoral College also makes candidates have to strategically plan out their campaign so they can focus on big states and swing states only. If a candidate knows he will not win a certain state he wont even focus on it because it would be pointless, even if he changes maybe a couple thousand voters' minds, it wont get him a single point if he loses that state 5000 15000 whereas with popular vote changing the mind of people so that you get yourself from having 10% of California's overall votes for you to 30% means more votes than literally all of alaskans eligible voting population. So that drives candidates away from states they wont win and they go to states known as ""swing states"" that dont have a specific party that they vote for every election, and they will attempt to win these states votes the most because those points will make the biggest difference.

The final thing I'd like to touch on is that the Electoral College system takes so many peoples idea and erases it. We want our vote to mean something throughout the whole campaign, but it doesnt matter if you are one the few democrat supporters in an overall republican dominated state because when your state loses 5000 to 150, poof! There goes your vote floating off into oblivion because it doesnt matter now, your one vote doesnt stand a chance against 50 going against it according to the Electoral College. We want our vote to count for the candidate himself not be part of some majorly flawed point system that someone thought would help somehow when picking the right candidate to become the head honcho sitting in charge of The White House, Our Country, and be the overall leader of our military forces too. So we need our vote to be heard and for it to actually count, even if 5000 more people disagree with 2500 in the same state, those 2500 votes should actually count towards something instead of being overrun and erased by the 5000 which will earn some candidate a couple of points for their campaign.

Now after all this not only has my own opinion strongly changed in favor of popular vote but I hope yours has too. Electoral College just doesnt provide that actual perfect accuracy of who wins that popular does, it forces presidents to only visit and campaign in certain states that they have a chance of winning, and it takes citizens votes and throws them down the drain if more people in the same state vote differently. It just makes you sit and wonder whos idea it was to accept this system."
694e6c72,1,"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is an anachronism. It belongs in the past and should not decide who are president is going to be anymore because its not who the majority of people really want to be leading,it could cause a tie,and its unfair to voters.

Abolishing the electoral college has been a thing people have wanted gone for some time. Because of the electoral college the popular vote has not effected who becomes president. According to the article,The Indivisible Electoral College,over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election tha the one we have now. this means many people would rather switch out the electoral college with a direct vote. With the electoral college still up voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose again.

Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in an election. According to the article,The Indivisible Electoral College,if the election was a tie it will be thrown to the House of Representatives,where state delegations vote on the president.This mean that people would still have no say in the matter of choosing a president.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. According to the article,during the 2000 campaign,seventeen states didnt see candidates at all. This means voters didnt even have a chance to vote.

The electoral college should be ruled out in the future because its not who people really want to lead,it could result in a tie, andits unfair to voters. If its removed then there would be better leaders in the future."
fc66f374,1,"The Electoral College was originally established as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Presidential candidate Al Gore actually won the popular vote done by citizens, but ended up losing the Electoral College voting which caused him to lose his campaign for presidency. To prevent further occurrences such as the fiasco involving Al Gore, the Electoral College must go. Former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter both happened to agree on the abolishment of the Electoral College! According to a gallop poll taken in the year 2000, over 60% of voters would prefer a more direct election process. In other words, they want the Electoral College system abolished.

Voters actually don't vote for President they vote for a slate of electors who end up voting for the president. I feel that this system isn't cohesive enough it's easy for people to think that a majority vote for a candidate means an automatic victory when actually the Electoral College votes are what truly matter. What would be the reaction if a certain member of the College decided to vote against his party's candidate? With a system filled to the brim with flaws, it's easy for many upsetting instances to occur in the future. In fact, the state of Louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.

During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The Electoral College method is outdated, at best. If seventeen states didn't even get to see the candidates, then something is obviously wrong. Had 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii voted the other way, a tie would've occurred in the 1976 presidential election.

There is one, gaping flaw in the Electoral College voting system the winnertakeall basis. A very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory! Another unfair aspect about the Electoral College is the fact that larger states garner more attention and votes! than do smaller ones. Florida netted candidate Obama 29 electoral votes whereas Wyoming snagged him 3 electoral votes. Such a discrepancy can turn off potential voters such as Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California. Overall, the Electoral College is an outdated practice which must be invalidated soon enough."
2e8c563c,0,"Man conquered its environment with advancements and technology, they make life easier but some are harmful to our environment. Automobiles were derived from carriges but unlike carriges automobiles required some kind of power to run on. Most vehicles in modern day run on gasoline, Diesel, or electricity. They make transportation easier for us but like every good apple it has its rotten side. Fumes produced by the burning of Diesel and Gasoline are harmful to our ozone. The fumes produce a greenhouse like effect and trap in the heat contributing to global warming. Although diesel engines have improved and are now cleaner our atmosphere is still taking a sucker punch. Almost every family in the United States owns an automobile, thats millions and millions of people driving increasing carbon emissions. If less people used their personnal vehicle they could save money and diminish the amount of pollution produced by their automobiles. There is no way we can obliterate car use because we have built our world centered on car use but we don't have to stop driving we could simply reduce our impact by using public transportation, walking or riding a bicycle. Walking or driving a bicycle could relieve stress while commuting and traffic jams increase your stress level do something for yourself and our environment and decrease your stress level.

The are many many reasons to decrease our reliance on automobiles yet even with many benefits we refuse to do our part. The amount of fossil fuels available in earth is limited, in the past decades we have used much of it there will soon come a day when we will experience a shortage of fossil fuel. The day will come regardless of anything because of our reliance in this source of power but we can slow down its arrival by using less. Americans use thousands and thousands of dollars a year to fill up their tanks, when they could walk or car pool and save money. They could use that money to pay bills, make improvements in their home or make a college found for their kids. Yet many preffer to drive and just burn their money away. The use of public transportation doesn't only save you money it can increase your comminities economy.

While i'm all for saving money there is a greater cause then just saving money. Although is obvious we could all use a few extra bucks in our wallet we could also use a healthier planet. We breath in the fumes that automobiles produce, carbon is not good for us its a health hazard. We are polluting the air we breath our body needs oxygen not carbon and yet that's a high percentage of what our lungs inhale. There is also the concern that carbon emissions are causing holes in our ozone layer. The ozone protects us from all the harmful rays that the sun emmits like Uvrays. There has been an increase of people sufferring from skin cancer in the last decade. why you may ask, well carbon emissions make holes in our ozone layer which in essance allows harmful sun rays to reach us. With a certain amount of exposure to radiation our cells experience mutations caused by the harmful rays and essancially give birth to cancer. Many people die because of this disease and we lament their loss but not enough to make a change. Pollution produced by automobiles has many negative effects on our environment, and health. We could decrease the damage by doing our part and leaving our car parked in the garage.

If saving money and having a cleaner environment isn't a good enough reason to limit you car usage then do for your own health. There is more to life then just driving impatienlty in a car you could walk and enjoy nature. Our reliance on cars is unhealthy for us and our environment. We are polluting our beautiful planet and causing an increase of health hazards. There is only so much fossil Fuel left we can waste it all at once or make it last a little longer. I myself enjoy the pleasure of just driving to a store rather than walking but i preffer a healthy environment over a car ride. Do your part walk, take a bus, or car pool with your friends. Every grain of sand counts."
df295c36,0,"A growing trend in day to day life that is occurring around the world is ""carfree"" day. Carfree day has spread in cities and towns around Europe and the Americas to separate suburban life from automobile use. This is beneficial in many ways to the growth, forward movement, and health of towns. So far Europe, Asia, and the Americas have given up car usage for a day, and even given up car usage entirely.

Different cities practice carfree day differently. In Paris, the nearrecord pollution was at its height. The city participated in carfree day by enforcing a partial driving ban and making people with even numbered license plates leave their cars at home. The following day, the odd numbered license plates were confined to home. Any person who didn't follow guidelines and conduct was fined. The congestion of smog in the capital of France decreased by sixty percent. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, like Brussels and London. By participating in the carfree day, Paris was able to contribute to cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions and temporarily fix a few environmental concerns in Paris. Even though they had some effective results, Paris wasn't the only city that participated in the trend.

Across the Atlantic ocean in Bogota, the program allowed Colombians of Bogota to hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. The carfree day left the normally busy, full and loud streets devoid of traffic jams. The goal to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog was enforced by minor fines. Despite the fact that rain showers were common, it did not stop the people from participating. The people of he town viewed it as a day of taking away stress and lowering ar pollution. The day without cars has been part of an improvement campaign since the mid 1990s, and has since been practiced at least one day out of the year. Authorities from countries all around the world have gone to the event and were impressed and some were inspired. Even other cities that are in colombia have joined the event like Cali and Valledupar.

Back in Europe, the city of Vauban, Germany, has taken place in a permanent carband. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are nearly forbidden in the experimental and new district of Freiburg. While car ownership is allowed, there are only two places to park. People that live there generally like the way of life in Vauban. Many of them sold their cars just to move there in the first place. The overall feeling of living in a city free of cars seems to lift stress of the people that live there. Therefore, the people are happier and more productive. Vauban is known as the most advanced experiment in attmepts to make suburbs more compact and have a minut number of vehicles. Supermarkets and stores as a result have been moved to a closer distance so that they could be walking distance away. Our development as people over the past century hads been based on the car, and Vauban goes completely against the idea that progress is based off of the car.

Even in America, Obama is ambitious to change the amount of the United States pollution. While although cities have yet to participate in carfree day, Citizens are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses across America each year. This gives researchers the idea that America is passed the peak driving level. American life has been integrated with cars from the time that the Model T was born. As the amount of jobs decrease, people just can not afford to buy cars. People in America have lost the general idea of a car and it's uses. Young adults in college have learned to use other ways of transport like carpooling with a friend, public transportation, or walking to the destination. The amount of people has dropped more than twenty percent and still continues to drop. This incipient stage of American life has implied the idea of alternatives to multiple motored vehicles.

Cities all around the world are deciding to practice their own car free day and are decreasing the use of cars altogether. The practice of carfree day has caused parks to initiate, sidewalks to be prepared repaired, cut traffic, give joy to the people, and overall diminish air pollution."
9fcd2d02,0,"In the world today you will see cars just about everywhere, whether it be a toyota pirus, or an 1999 honda civic. Car no doubly have been one of the largest, if not, the greatest inventions this world has ever seen. Although nowadays when we start to talk negativially about the car, people seem to turn their heads away to avoid the question. Reducing the use of cars in the world would be massively beneficial to the environment, and not only that, everyday life. Limiting car usage will help reduce pollution into the atmosphere through reducing carbon emissions, it will help save money and also it will help reduce stress and tense mindset.

One of the largest benefits of reducing car usage in the world is the reduction of greenhouse gases being released in to the atmosphere coming out the exhaust pipes of cars. According to In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from cars in car congested areas. In the passage the text explains how a social experiment turned into a growing trend in Europe today. In suburban town of Vauban, many people have utitmatly given up their cars. How this was done you may ask? In the town driveways are forbidden swell as home garages. Car Ownership isnt forbidden though,but to own a car is quite difficult and costly. With only two places to park in the whole town, it makes ownership very difficult. The lifestyle of people here without cars ultimately reduced stress and increased health, and much happier and healthier lifestyles were made. Another example will be in Paris, France. After the city received near recordbreaking pollution in the air, Paris officials took action. They banned driving for two days to attempt to reduce carbon emissions. The way they enforced this rule was by fines throughout the city for no cooperation. On that monday on the first day of the ban, only 4000 fines were given. Many people were complained of inconvience and companies complained of lost revenue, Although the incovencies, the ban for just one day reduced the smog almost completely and allowed for Pairs to lift the scheduled ban on that tuesday. So even though in some places the reduction of car usage may cause incovience, the reduction carbon emissions cant go unnoticed, and it is huge advantage.

Reduction of the usage of cars will not only reduce Greenhouse gases but it will also help people conserve and save money and stay stress free. Limiting car usage will save you money a couple ways, one of which is not having to fuel up your car to save money. Fuel prices are always moving up and down, but more recently they have been very high. For many people they are spending over 50 dollars at the pump just to dirve 50 or so miles. With reduction of car usage people wont have to spend as much money at the pump. Reduction of car usage will also help reduce spending money because it wont allow to buy things at certain stores that you have to drive too, and things like that. Another advantage of the reduction of the usage of the car is the reduce in stress for a person. In town of Vauban, Heidrun Waltert said, ""When I had a car, i was always tense. Im much happier this way."" This way he mean the way without a car."
b221129e,0,"Men are like ants. We are always in a rush and always desperate to arrive on time. The easiest way to arrive on time in any place, is by car. Cars, however, tend to do a lot more bad then they do good. Cars release large amounts of pollution and can raise smog and noise levels in areas where there is a lot of driving. Smog and pollution isn't very good for anybody, so some areas have taken preventative steps to keep Earth healthy and to keep people healthy as well. The shocking part is, the cars get cut out.

In some areas, like the experimental Vauban in Germany, cars are not allowed at all. No honking is heard when the sun rises, and streets are oddly empty. Shops are lined up within walking distance, and few buses run to allow for people to travel a little bit quicker. In fact, 70% of vaughn's population do not own cars, and many sold their cars for a chance to live in Vauban. The streets are safer, and people seem to be a lot less tense about things, when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun, an occupant of Vauban. Vauban has proved that removing the car entirely can help to calm people, and even redesign the way cities and homes work to provide safer, cleaner areas for man to live in.

Cars can need to be removed for more negative reason as well. Paris, France, had sever issues with the amount of smog in the city. Smog can be incredibly dangerous, making large chances of acid rain and possible issues with breathing. France has had one of the largest amounts of smog when compared to many other cities, usually only beat by Beijing, which in one of the most polluted areas. France knew, however, that the city could not possibly handle having every car taken away in a night, so they attempted to cut a half off for each day. For a week, fines were placed on cars with license plates that ended in either an even or odd number, the taxes applied more specifically to which license plates would be tagged, odd on one day, even the next. The large fines did not persuade everyone, however, and 4,000 driviers were still fined. The week of cutting down cars, however, proved to work very well and cut down on the amount of smog quickly and carefully so that everyone would have a safer and cleaner Paris.

In Bogota, Columbia, the removal of cars is celebrated as if it were a holiday. Each year on one day everyone will refrain from driving to skateboard, bike, walk, hike, or any number of modes of transportation to prevent the usage of cars. The city does this not only as a fun way to promote an ecofriendly Bogota, but to cut down on it's own smog issues. Like any capital of any country, there's a lot of movement, and with movement comes cars, and with cars: smog. Their event has even inpired many other cities and countries to do the same thing, continuously aiding in the fight against global warning.

Even America, the gasguzzling, NASCAR approving, roadrage warriors of the world, try to cut down on car usage. The issue has even reached the President. America has found that slowly but surely that men and women are slowly moving away from the car as a mode of transportation. Since 2005, car usage has dropped tremoendously in favour of public transportation like trams and buses."

9f345348,0,"Humankind has always been fascinated with the concept of cars. Motorized vehicles that effortlessly take you from one area to another when compared to more traditional methods such as walking. Everyone wanted a car for themselves to become a part of the innovation. But as time has passed, we now realized that it was naive of us to think cars were going to revolutionize transport, as some of the more simpler ways of transport bike riding, bus outshined car ownership in practicality and efficiency.

Now more than ever, alternative transportation methods are being promoted heavily in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. A shining example of this is in Paris, France ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", source two, where the government took the initiative to limit the usage of vehicles to reduce the amount of smog in the city.

Paris, one of the most idolized cities in the world, was at a point where the density of smog and pollutants in the air rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. However, after the driving ban in Paris, the city saw a drastic reduction in the amount of pollutants in the air, as it dropped down from 147 micrograms of particulate mattercubic meter. Not only that, but Paris also saw an improvement in car traffic, dropping down to 40 percent of what it originally was five days after the ban.

With all this in mind, how does this benefit the population without looking at the pollution reduction? This can also benefit us physically and psychologically. In Bogota, Colombia, a generally congested city, filled with traffic jams and other problems Mayor Antanas Mockus promoted alternative transportation in the ""Day Without Cars event""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, source 3. In an effort to encourage public transportation in the city of 7 million inhabitants, Mockus promoted an event in which the only form of motorized transportation available was taxi cabs and bus rides. This mean that the people took the opportunity to bike, walk, hike from one point to another. Subsequently, this also indirectly promoted physical fitness and a stress release for people wanting to take the chance to enjoy their day. As Carlos Plaza evidently states that it is a great way to take away stress, while on a bike ride with his wife. Colombia has also opened up new bike path, parks, and sports centers, which is all the more proof that this initiative is promoting physical fitness and psychological wellness.

One could argue that this revolution of alternative transportation could have negative consequences on car industries and other businesses that rely on personal vehicle, and they wouldn't be wrong. But this phenomenon doesn't necessarily have to hurt anyone, as these same industries can promote their time and resources on projects that also promote alternative transportation. Just as well, in recent years, the amount of people getting driver's licenses and relying on personal vehicles has seen a significant decline, such as the amount of young prople driving decreaed 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, or when a study showed the amount of miles driven by the average American peaked in 2005 and steadily declined since then The End of Car Culture, Source 4. People started to see the efficiency of alternative transportation, and capitalized on the opportunity to make transportation more accessible to everyone. Whether its from the expanding bicycle paths in New York City, to the Bay Area Rapid Transport in San Francisco, these are just a few examples of the steadily growing list of cities promoting more accessible transportation.

So with all of this in mind, there is irrefutable evidence that the more simpler methods of alternative transportation to limit vehicular usage is more efficient and practical. As seen in Paris where the city saw a significant drop in the amount of smog the city contained. Or when Bogota where an event that banned vehicular usage promoted physical and psychological wellness. People opting for alternative transportation is the global phenomenon that benefits us in more ways than we can imagine. There""s no doubt that the older, more traditional methods of transportation out perform personal vehicles in efficiency."
205bfb3b,1,"Dear state senator, Hello my name is PROPER_NAME and I am writing to you about our voting system. Many individuals are not content with the Electoral College and many are. You could see both sides, but that does not mean we should switch to election by popular vote. Here are a few reasons on why the Electoral College method is the way to go.

During election by popular vote there is a great chance that there could be a ""tie"". A tie would cause a great set back in the voting process due to the fact that there would have to be more votes cast or even longer campaigns. In the Electoral College system we don't have to worry about things like that happening. Yes, disputes are possible, but they are very rare. As stated in article three under the headline certainty of outcome, the reason for very few disputes is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote. It is highly unlikely for a tie to occur.

Article three line twentytwo reads "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."". One example of this is in 1968 Nixon only had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, but won the majority in the Electoral College. Another example is in 1992 when Clinton also only had 43 percent of popular vote but majority in the Electoral College. Source three line twentythree states "" It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.."". This is true but the Electoral College is still more efficient due to the fact there are rarely ever any ties.

The Electoral College eliminates the power of a large population, everything is equal. The winnertakeall method induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. Voters in the toss up states are likely to be te most thoughtful, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. The case in the popular vote method is very different.

Over all you can see that the Electoral College method is the way to go. There are les bumps in the road and it is very efficient. There are rarely any ties, everything is fair, and it avoids runoff elections. We should not switch to the popular vote method."
c2c66921,1,"Florida Senator I had not known much about the electoral college until now, and I am appalled that this election process has been used ever since the establishment of the Constitutiondecades ago. The electoral college is unfair, raises dispute, does not provide an accurate representation of the country's vote as a whole, and the process is simply not logical. I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.

First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential candidate, they are not. Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president. Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions? Anyone would agree that the people should have the power to contribute to these decisions, yet somehow the electors are taking this huge responsibility into their own hands.

Another issue with the electoral college is that it gives candidates different motives for their campaign. I believe that in an electoral campaign, candidates should be advertising their views equally to all parts of the country, if all parts of the country get to have a say in their voting. However, most of the time, entire countries are skipped over by candidates, as if they don't matter, so that the candidates can talk to states that they find more important to get a vote from. In the election of 2000, a seventeen whole states didn't see the candidates at all, and some of the larger states didn't see a single campaign ad. If the presidents know that they are practically guaranteed the electoral votes by a state, why would they waste their time trying to persuade a state that is already persuaded? It makes sense for the candidates to see ""swing states""the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another. I don't blame the candidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning.

The last problem with the electoral college that I would like to address is how the electoral college discourages people from certain states from voting. For example, a Rebulican in California or a Democrat in Texas are obviously aware that their vote isn't going to count towards the majority of the state's votes, or to which candidate the state's electoral votes will be going to. People are definitely more likely to vote if they know that their vote will be heard in some way. The ""winner takes all"" method is eliminating any representation of the opposing party's vote and discourages the minority of the state from voting. Everyone says that being a good citizen requires being aware and involved with government decisions, and voting whenever possible, yet in the 2012 election, onehalf of Americans that were eligible to vote, did not. I'm sure that a good portion of nonvoters were influenced by the unfair ways of the electoral college.

As you can see, the electoral college brings about many issuesissues that could be easily avoided if the electoral college was changed to the much simpler and straight forward popular voting system. Our country would be accurately represented, people would feel as if their vote actually makes a difference, presidential campaign would be consistent for all states, and we would actually be able to vote for the specific person we are trying to vote for in the first place. With all of these reasons been said, I think it is pretty clear that the electoral college should be abolished, and that government should change to election of the president of the United States simply by popular vote."
fafc5912,0,"Smog, acid rain, high carbondioxide levels, all of these things are due to pollution. In many countries the leaders have put a ban towards cars. Paris France, Vauban Germany, Bogota Colombia, and even the United States of America haveare thinking about putting a ban on cars or other transporting objects. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage limiting pollutians in the air, saving money, and having a healthier life style.

Cars can cost a pretty penny epically if their new, and many lowmiddle class family's have trouble keeping up with the bills that come with a car. Car payments alone can run up to 300 a month. Then theirs insurance, and if your car happends to need a change of oil, or breaks theirs another 200300 dollar payment. That's why people are starting to buy fewer and fewer cars each year. After the peek in 2005 car percheses have droped tremendously, with less people deciding to get a license.

Not getting you license dosn't mean you cant get around, it just means that you have to find other means of transportation. Biking, walking, even riding on your skateboard can get you from point A to point B. Cars are bigining to become obsolete, not being used in large suburbs, or highly populated cities. People have started to walk to work and that has a largee impact on health. With people having privet cars they dont feel the need to have physical activity every day. This could be contributing to obesity. With cars being out of mind people are starting to get exersize just by walking to work. Cars have also contributed to many deaths all over the world. With new technology coming out many drivers get distracted. Wether its talking on their phones, trying to pick up something thats' dropped in the back seat, or even trying to dig something out of your purse. Not all drivers are a fault tho, many other accidents happen because of pedestrians not paying attention. These accidents could be prevented though, by just getting rid of the use of cars.

Passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gass additions in europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the Unites States. If we got rid of most privetly owned cars though, it world bring that pecentige down tremendously. In Paris the record high pollution finally had them pass a partial driving ban untill the thick smog cleard the city streets. congestion was down 60% in the streets of paris, and after 5 days of intensifying smog it had finally cleard.

Cars all over the world are slowly becoming less and less used. This could help the pollution, health and save money. these advantiges to getting rid of cars is going to become a topic thast we will talk alot about for ages, until cars become compleetly and totaly obsolite."
3b654100,0,"Last year in 2014, the earth had the warmest temperature in recorded history. Needless to say, this is due to greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide. One of the major reasons behind an increase in greenhouse gases is due to the use of cars and motorcycles, which release high amounts of carbon dioxide. It is to our benefit that we prevent any form of unnatural climate change on earth, and the most effective way to execute this is by living a more ""carfree"" life, especially here in the United States as it is our second most contributing factor of our increasing greenhouse gases. America could follow the path that many other countries and cities took.

In Vauban, Germany, cars have been banned unless one should decide to buy a permit in the form of a public garage. Most citizens take other means of transportation than cars. They walk, use bicycles, or public transportation. This has resulted in Vauban having a much cleaner environment and less stress as a result of no traffic. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" confesses Heidrun Walkter. Building suburbs like Vauban would result in a lower production of air pollution and a much more stress free environment.

Bogota has a similar policy as Vauban, but only lasts one day of the year. However, that only serves the citizens to be more enthusiastic about the event. Most people were glad to help out in anyway to reduce the smog. Bogota has also inspired other cities to do the same. Cali and Valledupar also decided to encourage this ecofriendly day. A day might not be much out of three hundred and sixty four, but a small contribution from a large mass of people can make a huge change. Implementing this same policy in more cities and countries would result in a notable change in the amount of air pollution around that time of year.

Paris resently executed a policy to ban cars with oddnumbered plates on Tuesdays as a consequence from a heavy smog that was brewing for several days. Paris had a smog of higher concentration than London, having 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter while London only had 78.7. There were residents who were unhappy with the ban, but the benefits the city gained from it were outstanding. Traffic was down by 60 percent and and as a recompensation for those who could not use their cars, public transportation was free from Friday to Monday. Due to the dedication of the mayor and citizens, the smog cleared up enough for the ban to be lifted. Making this a something a whole nation can participate in would definately improve the annual greenhouse gas emmssions.

Limiting car usage can have a posotive heavy impact on the world as a whole if more people were to follow the examples of these cities. The year of 2014 was known as the hottest year in recorded history, and it undoubtedly has to do with how much greenhouse gasses we emmited. If we could follow the example of those cities, we could see a great change by the end of the year 2015. This change could fix the climate problems we're currently having, and create a healthier, happier world."
35db0aa4,1,"Dear, I believe that the way of voting for a president though the Electoral College is outdated. The popular vote should be deciding who becomes president. Some Runnerups have had the backing of the popular vote and not won because of the Electoral College. Several things you should consider is people can actually vote though popular vote, the minority will have a better chance, and presidents have lost to the Electoral College.

First, People can actually vote, when people go to vote for the next president or the returning one they arent actually voting for the president they are voting for electoral votes but some state wont even allow people to vote for that. Some states the electors vote for who they want and the peoples votes they are accounting for become nothing. They go out and vote for nothing. "" Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.""source 2 This is what can happen when poeple can vote who they want and u have electors doing it for them they will put someone in the race that no one wants to really be there. But some poeple say that the Electoral College is there to help us and to help most states have the winner take all system. "" The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""source 2 which means that they won't visit every state because there is no reason to visit some.

Next, The minority will have a chance, If there ever is a deadlock in the campaign the voting will have to go to the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. So the minority won' have much of a chance."" Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" source 3 that means a close election isn't so close anymore because of Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie. "" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538 is an even number.""source 3 continuing on that note, Runnerups have lost due to electoral vote but have won the popular vote.""According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore tanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost presidency.""source 2 Which means Al Gore would have been president and not the other guy. Which would have changed today in one way or another. Some people do say The electoral vote is for the better. "" The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President."" source 1But why do they get to vote for them and we dont.

In Conclusion, The Electoral College should be eradicated and the popular vote should take its place. The popular vote is better because people can actually vote, the minority will have a chance, Presidents loss becasue of Electoral Vote but win the Popular vote. In the end the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational."
aa3115a0,0,"Now and days, our world has transformed from using simple transportation to one source: the automobile. However, recent studies have shown our slow progression for the past years, discovering other ways of getting to point A to point B by having programs, reducing pollution and smog along the way, and living in an affordable economy.

To begin with, cities in our world have proven to be ""carfree cities"" by allowing programs to show other ways of transportation and reducing pollution and smog along the way. In Bogota, Colombia, a program where it is ""a car free day"", millions of colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work and as Enrique rivera mentions in source 3, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution paragraph 24"". Colombia has been hosting this program since the 1990's and it has spread around the world the influence Colombia has done is beyond incredible. Although the program is not held everyday, it impacts the world slowly. Also, in source 2, the usage of car in France has decreased drastically because of the ""intensifying smog paragraph 14"". Because their tax policy ""favors diesel over gasoline paragraph 16"", they're required to use diesel, but the French decide to rebel to save the environment, in result causing delivery companies to complain. Although, because the French did use less cars it made the smog clear up. In all, programs such as the one held in Colombia influence all arts of the world with showing other ways of transportation and even saving the environment.

In addition, the world continues to reduce the use of cars because it becomes more affordable to the people. When the economy crashed in the United State's, people relied on their cars, until they realized it was too expensive to pay gas, pay parking, but needed an alternative and as it says in source 4, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit...paragraph 36"". People do not want to go back to a car based economy. They're finding other affordable sources. Not only does the usage of cars affect people financially, but also emotionally. In Vauban, Germany, as a result of forbidding street parking, house garages and fee's, 70 percent of the famalies do not own cars and Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, who usually bikes, expesses herself about the situation in source 1, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Clearly, the use of less cars result in a finacial plus and an emotional change as well.

In conclusion, ""car free days"" are much more effective in a way that demonstrates the world other options of transportation, an opportunity to save the enoviroment, and an affordable economy to all."

During ithis campaignn in 2000, Al Gore received more individual voites ithan George W.

Iit is obvious ithait ithe voites of ithe Elecitoral College do noit accuraitely reflecit ithe opinions of ithe people, and gives ithe ciitizens of our counitry poor represenitaition in our governmenit.

The argumenits in favor of ithe Elecitoral College are weak ait besit. In ithe ariticle ""In Defense of ithe Elecitoral College: Five reasons ito keep our despised meithod of choosing ithe Presidenit"" by Richard A. Posner, ithe opening paragraph is pracitically an argumenit againsit ithe Elecitoral College. In ithe ariticle, Posner sitaites, ""The Elecitoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocraitic meithod of seleciting a presidenit... ithe advocaites of ithe posiition are correcit in arguing ithait ithe Elecitoral College meithod is noit democraitic... iit is ithe elecitors ithait choose ithe presidenit, noit ithe people.""

982966d0,0,"Cars most are used by workers, mothers, and pretty much all people in any urban area, they get us from point A to point B. But, as much as we use automobiles do we really need them? They produce smog, endanger our children and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmospheric destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.

In Paris, a few days after nearrecord pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris Robert Duffer, par. 14. This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprisingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.

In Vauban, Germany there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost 40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3. And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.

Car free areas have not been limited to just Europe though in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 32. Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, ""What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33. The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this carfree revolution.

To wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this carfree quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America's packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has longterm effect on our children. Please consider this, car in the long run are bad for the economy but, as well our health. It's snowing on Mt. Fuji."
6e88a706,0,"The effects of greenhouse gas emission began to take their toll on the earth's atmosphere simply by its own natural output. As time has gone on though, and humans and their ways of transportation have evolved, greenhouse gas emission is becoming more of a problem. Automobiles, mainly cars, play a huge role in the production of nasty fumes and gases that become trapped in the atmosphere. For example, in Europe passenger cars make up twelve percent of total greenhouse gas emission, and in heavily congested areas such as the United Statesit can skyrocket up to fifty percent!

Some nationscountries are beginning to take a new approach to battle the ""War of Greenhouse Gases"". As studies have shown that national driving levels and the amount of people purchasing cars and earning their licenses are dropping after their peak in 2005, people are more and more willing to put down the car keys and put on their running shoes. One of these places in particular is the city of Vauban and is located in Germany. It is a middleclass to upper class community and its citizens can be considered pioneers of suburbia. Vauban does not permit driving in it's limits, besides the main thoroughfare, and a few side streets. Car owners buy a space for their car for 40,000 alongside a home.

While some might argue about the practicality of not driving your car if you have one, it's shown to be extremely beneficial not only for the environment, but for people as well. When you go outside, whether you're headed somewhere or just on a casual stroll, you may reach Nirvana as you enjoy the true sounds of nature. In places where cars are permitted to drive, you might hear the sound of birds chirping outside your window, or the calm rustle of leaves rustling in the wind, but the rumbles, roars, and honks of a car are not far behind. In areas such as Vauban, the beautiful sounds of the world won't be drowned out by a greasy hunk of steel.

Besides feeling at peace, a life without a car is a healthier life! Now, when you want to go somewhere, you must rely on your own two feet. Those two feet, bicycle, skateboard, etc. will be all you need to get where you're going! Unlike many places though, everything is within walking distance for convenience and to encourage you to take these steps. Notice the physical and emotional changes in yourself once in a place with no carsyou'll feel more relaxed, less rushed, and your body will thank you."
a98fb39a,0,"Living in a world covered in dark,suffocating smog is not the first thing that comes to mind when we imagine an ideal environment. The smog that hangs over our head at this very moment is an example of what humanity has contributed to this worlds health,disease. If we call this our home then we should find a suitable solution to provide a more stable condition of the Earth's wellbeing. Limiting car use is a universal solution in which countries across the globe are taking part of. It has been shown on numerous occasions that limiting car usage, or even going to the extreme of banning them, has created a stress free atmosphere, a healthier world, and has lead to economic growth.

The ""smart planning"" trend that has grown in popularity in the United States and Europe is a stepping stone to how we plan to stop the exaggerated use of cars. In Vauban, Germany with their 5,500 residents have made the ultimate sacrifice and have completly given up cars, besides the 40,000 parking spot you wish to obtain along with your house. A residence has remarked on how she was ""...happier this way than when she had a car,""that when she had a car she was ""always tense,"" not the exact response most people believe, yet eliminating that rushed environment has increased the supporters of anticars. businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza from Bogota, Columbia which has implemented an effective program that has banned the use of cars on certain days looks at this event as a ""good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" and as it has shown he seems to be right on that.

12% of the atmospher over Europe is made of of greenhouse gases while in a America, where car use is more frequent, in certain congested spots could be as high as 51%. Cars make an incredible barrier as to what we can achieve in environment conservation. On a Monday in Paris the city of lights the use of cars was banned by the government for the fog was at to of a horrendous state they needed to ""clear the air of a global city."" Even though on average the plague that is infesting the atmospher is approximately 147 micrograms of particulate matterPM per square meter, while in Brussels it is 114PM and in London 79.7, if this is what it is on average imagine how much worse it must've been to banish the use of cars to clear the air. Even though it seems to be quite a scarafice, as we see in Paris 4,000 people were fined for driving on that Monday and 27 of them had their cars impounded purely based on their reaction, we see a trend of the decresing intrest of buying and using cars anyway and after a point in time we see a posotive result in the long run. As Drexel University sociology professor puts it ""...we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift,"" as in relation to America one of the leaders in car production and passion. Preventing the use of cars will substantially help the environment, just that one day of a driving ban on Paris was able to let the smog clear up enought to allow driving the next day, I guess you can see those lights a little brighter now.

Part of the ""smart planning"" trend we are able to recognize is a need to aid in the effort to save our home. The fact it promotes healthy living and an increase in businesses in suburbs making tsuburbs more in touch with consumers needs as seen in Botoga where ""parks and sports centers have bloomed,"" and ,""new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,"" it has morphed stressed societies into happier ones, and the potential to make for a better world is something undenyably needed in society today, a change to help us all."
382908e0,1,"Dear state senator, We should not decide the president by electoral college. Mainly because it's unfair to the voters who took the time out of their day to vote, but then realized they wasted their time because their vote doesn't mean anything, the electors decide who the president is not the voters. The article the Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong states ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote for not the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What's the point of voting if our vote basically doesn't matter because we are not the one choosing who is president. The same article also states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" We the voters basically don't even decide who's president, the electors do, and we don't even get to pick who the electors are, the state legislatures do. Why is the president based off of who the electors want? there's only 538 of them, it should be based off popularity, the vote of the millions of the people who have voted. Honestly i see no point in voting now since our votes don't decide who the president will be.

Electoral college is unfair to the small states. The article five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president' shows a map of America with the number of electoral votes given to each state. If you look at the map, you'll notice that the bigger states have more electoral votes, and the small states have very few. For example California has 55 electoral votes, Texas has 38, and Florida has 29. But states such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine have less than 5 electoral votes. Which basically means that their electoral votes don't count nearly as much as the big states do. If we decided the president by popularity among everyone who voted, it would actually be fair to everyone, and more people would vote.

The article five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president' states ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" I don't blame them when the artcile also states ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose presidency."" Then what's the point of voting when our vote doesn't matter."
0bbff1f5,0,"Why are the streets always so jammed!? Everyone asks that all the time almost everyday around 5:00pm. The reason for is because cars being excessively used nowadays. There are several different advantages that can happen when limiting car usage. The world would be a better place if less cars were used on the roads.

To begin with, why do we the people use cars? The reason is because it can get us from A to B really fast. But that's only 1 positive for the usage of cars. Think about the negatives and disadvantages of using cars. My 1 main reason of the usage of cars is that it make the world less active. Walking or running is a daily form of exercise, and the usage of cars is limiting the numbers of that. In section 1 redrum Walter says that he always was tense when he had a car, he's much happier without one. This is why we should limit the usage of cars. We don't want the people to be tense all the time, we want them to enjoy and relax when using transportation other than cars. Walking will take longer but is better in the long run. You don't have traffic jams, you can go places and areas that cars couldn't fit through and you have many different ways of getting to a particular place rather than just a road. The only repercussion that you have to worry about with walking is the rain. But heres the thing, In section 3 Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" This means rain isn't a problem when walking on the streets. Cars may offer more protection but its more dangerous than walking. This is why places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota are trying to carry out the experience of a ""carfree"" life.

In addition, another advantage of limiting car use is limiting riots. I know we have all heard of people screaming and arguing in the cars of people in front or behind them. This is a big problem nowadays and it's because of the use of cars. If we can limit the usage of cars than we can hopefully reduce the level of aggrevation on the streets. Alot of accidents happen everyday dealing with the usage of cars. Cars provoke alot of deaths if you think about it. If we could limit the usage of driving cars than this will limit the amount of deaths per year by cars. That's the number 1 disadvantages to the using of cars. Walking and biking are my 2 favorite types of transportation because it's smooth, and it's more conveinant. Less accidents and injurys happen when walking or riding a bike. This can also help the streets be less packed which will allow for easier access to certain places. DUI is the main worst tragic that comes from the usage of cars. Many people die everyday because of drunk drivers and thats not respectable. Just imagine if the same person who caused an accident in the car while drunk was drunk on the streets while walking, he more than likely couldn't of caused an accident if he was walking and not driving a car. Just think about all of the disadvantages that cars promote.

Last but not least, comes the president Barack Obamas most valuable reason to limit car usage. Obama wants to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions, and by that he wants to get fewer cars on the road. In section 4 it shows that ""studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This means that Obama's goal is prevailing. Paris came to a conclusion that they decided to ban driving due to smog. In section 2 it states that Paris air became so polluted that they enforced a parial ""driving ban"" to get rid of the air pollution. They blamed this problem due to the diesel fuel. They figured out that diesels make up 67% of vehicles in France, as to 53% in the rest of Western Eurpoe. In section 2 its pretty much the same reason except Bogota's goal is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The violators faced 25 fines."" They figured limiting car usage was a good opportunity to take away stress and reduce air pollution. In section 4 the last paragraph tells you what Bill Ford plan was. He wanted to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, onserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" These are some advantages of less car usage. Many good things will start to happen if everyone could lower the usage of cars nowadays. We don't want the world to have polluted air, we don't want to promote car accidents, and we also don't want under age drivers on the streets. So take in mind the disadvantages of usage of cars and compared the to the the advantages of limiting car usage."
55a611ad,0,"In today's world, many of us see cars as a necessary tool used to get us where we need to go in the shortest time possible. However, what many do not realize is how much restricting our usage of the personal automobile will actually help society in the long run. Decreasing our usage of the car will not only cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve congestion and see an a boost in the economy of cities and countries around the world.

There is no doubt that cutting down on driving will greatly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. As detailed in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, the effect of just one day of reduced driving played a significant impact on the amount of smog in Paris, France. The smog which covered the city of Paris rivaled that of Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cause of the intense fog is thought to be diesel fuel, which is the most commonly used type of automobile fuel in France. Because of this, Paris has a very high smog concentration compared to other Western European capitals. The temporary ban on driving drastically improved the conditions in Paris, and the ban was lifted after only one day. If this idea of reducing the use of automobiles spreader to other cardependent countries such as the U.S., there is no telling how much the impact of society on the emission of greenhouse gasses will reduce.

Additionally, the increasingly popular idea of favoring walking or biking over driving to one's destination has seemed to have a significant impact around the world. In the passage ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the capital city of Bogota, Colombia has participated in the Day Without Cars program for three straight years. This has led to an increase in the creation of bicycle paths and cut down on congestion and traffic jams normally common in the city. In addition, the uprising of parks and recreation centers has also helped to boost the city's economy. However, this program has not been restricted to Bogota, as many people from countries around the world have come to see the event. This has the potential to become an internationally now phenomena, which will greatly improve the health and wellbeing of the people of the world. New bicycling opprotunities will mean no longer getting in traffic jams and will reduce stress and congestion in the long run.

In conclusion, the limiting of car usage would have a profound impact on our society, not only on pollution and the envorinment, but on our personal wellbeing. The limiting of our dependency on cars has had a great effect on the emission of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and smog has the potential to be removed from modern cities all together the economy would also benefit, as fewer cars means fewer roads needing to be built and an increase of bicycle trails, parks, and shopping centers in walking distance of neighborhoods. Overall, the limiting of car usage would have a fantastic impact on society and our world as a whole."
74371080,1,"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is widely acknowledged for serves a purpose as a method of selecting a president and vice president, not a legitimate college. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between having the President elected by a vote in Congress and an election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This process of choosing a president needs to be modified into popular vote for the reasons that the Electoral College was established to actually vote a slate of electors, voters feel disenfranchised, and is unfair to voters.

To begin with, the Electoral College was actually established for voters to vote for a series of electors, which then get together to have the final decision. Stated in ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, "" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise...process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" This means that under this system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors who then elect the president. The voters sometimes aren't told full front that they are chosing someone else and not always can they control who their electors are voting, leaving many puzzled. Voters aren't to be puzzled. They are to vote who they'd like because it allows them a freedom to express who they want because they are strongly acknowledged of the troubles of their society and how they should be handled.

In addition, the Electoral College makes voters feel discouraged and disenfranchised. According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, it is stated, "" No region...has enough electoral votes to lect a president...residents of the other regions are likely to feel...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president."" This means that voters feel that the president they chose is their president because they believe their votes count.

furthermore, the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because the candidates they ""vote"" for don't spend time with them. Sizes matter to the candidates. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, it is stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates do't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" This quote conveys that because some states are small in population and size, they will not help the candidate succeed. This is immensely discouraging to the voters because they feel worthless for not being big in size. Candidates should not have an excuse to not thank all their voters because every vote counts, not matter how small.

Admittedly, the Electoral College allows a clear and certain outcome because it exceeds the popular vote, however, the method is actually turning off potential voters for a candidate. The popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the popular president.

In the final analysis, a change is needed because with the Electoral College many candidates are losing potential voters considering that the qualified feel that they arn't doing much by voting considering they aren't voting for the president, but a gamut of electors to vote for them. They alos express the feeling of discontent and unfairness because they feel that they don't count and know they have no chance at winning."

The Electoral College is a very controversial topic when it comes to electing a president. Many people think it's a system that works fine, while others think it's a complete disaster. When it comes down to it, the Electoral College is a compromise between electing a president through congress and electing president by popular vote. In the past the Electoral College has caused problems in presidential elections and it can easily cause more problems that are much more severe than what we've seen in the past. America is all about democracy, so why don't the citizens get complete control by being able to elect their president directly? It's about time that the government finds a system that works better and gets rid of the Electoral College once and for all.

The electoral College has many flaws, a major one being that voters don't actually vote for their president, they vote for electors, and the electors are the ones who elect the president. You may ask yourself, ""What's wrong with this? One way or another we're still choosing the candidate we want."" While that is somewhat true, the system has many kinks that need to be fixed causing errors in the process. One example of this is the ""winner takes all"" rule. An excerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" says ""... the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"". At a basic level, this means candidates will only focus on some states, and giving up on others. In fact, the same article also says ""During the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't see the candidates at all..."" The facts prove it it, the Electoral College is a flawed, and unfair system, and it needs to be dealt with.

Another huge problem with the Electoral College is called ""the disaster factor"". According to Bradford Plumer, "" The American poeple should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" Plumer then explains how in Louisiana the legislature almost replaced the democratic candidates with some who opposed John F. Kennedy so that the popular vote wouldn't go to him, but rather someone else. This is a fine example of how corrupt this system can become if someone actually manages to pull something like this off. Other problems like a state sending two slates of electors to congress, or a tie in the electoral vote can happen, and there are some solutions to these problems, but why even go through them when a new system can be created altogether?

People like Richard A. Posner argue that we should keep the Electoral college. Posner believes that the Electoral College balances the weight between big and small states. The Electoral College gives big states less electoral votes and smaller states more to balance things out. I don't see this as balancing anything. Now the smaller states have an advantage over the bigger states, so you still have the same problem you began with. Posner also argues that voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns, but Plumer clearly contradicts this in his article. He states ""... seventeen states didn't see the campaign at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad."" The proof is irrefutable, the Electoral College has it's loop holes which seem fairly easy to get through. The system is outdated, it's time for a new system to take its spot.

I stand my ground when I say the Electoral College should ber abolished. The people should have full control over the election of our president, and even if that's not possible, the system is very corrupt. While some still agrue that the Electoral College is working fine, the proof shows it isn't. It either needs to be renewed or replaced altogether."
17340273,0,"In the United States of America, and all over the world, cars are used every day. People use them to get to work, to go see family, and to get simply, from A to B, but a new idea is sprouting up in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere where people are doing something unheard of.... giving up their cars. According to Source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", Vauban, Germany is a city that is almost completely car free. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" THis shows that living without cars is not only possible, but could have some great consequences.

Living car free could seem like something impossible, but it has great effects. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a study revealing that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe....and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Without cars, we could lower pollution, which is a huge problem for some places. In the second article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris has to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city after days of nearrecord pollution. Motorist with even number licence plates were ordered to leave their cars on day and motorists with odd numbered plates were ordered to the next day. This enforcement had positive consequences along with it. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital and the smog hanging over the city eventually cleared. This shows almost immediate benefits to the decline in driving. Can you imagine the benefits after a long term period of carfree cities? The possibilities are limitless.

Carfree periods of time don't have to be long term. In Bogota, Colombia, a carfree day takes place every year and it is a ""big hit"" with millions of Colombians according to the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". For the third straight year, cars have been banned only excluding busses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog in the city of 7 million. Anyone who violated the rules were fined 25 dollars. For the first time ever, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined in the event. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This should show that car free periods of time are possible, not matter how long, and that they have great consequences that come along with them.

You might say that it would be extremely difficult to make America a car free country. Well, according to a report in the fourth article ""The End of Car Culture"" America may be on it's way. Research studues show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The nummber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to a analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Thsi shows that there is a steady decline in driving and autiomotive transport in America. Also found in the fourth article, if the pattern persists, it will have beneficial impliactions for carbon emissions and the enviorment. Many sociologists believe the pattern will continue. Alternate sources of transportation have popped up also. In New York, a new bike sharing program has popped up and in San Fransisco, Bay Arear Rapid Transit is another viable option of transport. With all of these options, doesn't one fit you?

In conclusion, alternate transport oppurtunities and car free periods of time are the solution. With so many ways to lower how much and how you drive. The switch to a more economic means of transport would be easier than you think. The possibilities are endless and multiple studies show that the good consequences outweigh the bad ones."
a7b9ddde,1,"The Electoral College is not perfect and it may be called broken by some people, but in all truth it isn't. Nothing is perfect. The Electoral College is a good way to make sure that a election won't end in a tie 95% of the time. It also makes sure that certain regions, or states, don't control the vote with their population. The Electoral College can be edited if it needs to though.

The Electoral College is very good at insuring one winner. It has this ability, because to be a tie both candidates have to have 269 votes which is highly unlikely. To have a President chosen majority has to vote one way 270. Now with a ""winnertakesall"" system that his country, USA, has, there are only so many combinations of states' votes for one party that there would be a tie. Since the beginning of the Electoral College there has only been two ties. The Electoral College does make it easier for there not to be a tie, because more people voting into selected individuals then having them vote makes it easier for less mess ups and faster counting of votes.

The Electoral College also makes sure one part of the country does not get favored and make the others feel like their votes did not count. If one candidate is favored in a area and if it has a lot of people then that candidate would win with a direct vote. The bigger cities with more people would get every political ad and the candidates would be more focused there instead of getting everyone's opinion. The other places would feel left out and would be less likely to vote meaning not a true meaning of who majority wants as President.

Nothing is the world is ever made perfect forever. The Electoral College was clearly a great idea when it was made or it would never be put into action. The Electoral College does have slight problems that rarely happen. The best thing about it though is that people could vote and change details about it if it was that big of a deal. As ""Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution,"" people wanted thought it would be fair to count the District of Columbia as a ""state."" So people took a vote to make the change, thats why it is the the 23rd Amendment. When the USA gets more population, for a short time, there will be a odd amount of electoral votes, that means no ties. Until the popluation grows or decreases enough to make a even number of votes again.

There is pleanty of things wrong in this world, but one thing that is pretty good right now is the Electoral College. More times than not it has one winner and one loser, and rarely a tie. It makes sure that nobody is a favorite or feels like it. Also it shows things can change if something is a problem or needs fixing. The Electoral College is not perfect, but is not broken. Thank you for reading my letter, I hope you take it into concideration when deciding to keep it or not."
7e063298,0,"imagine a world, twenty or so years from now, completely free of any nature. there is not a single tree, bush, flower or even a blade of grass to be found. only concrete roads and dirt everywhere, along with our cars driving on them. in the cars are us, fat lazy people sitting in our cars, irritated and hollering out profanity at the mile long row of traffic as we try to get ot work. the cause of all this is toxic gases emitted by our cars. this is our future. do we really want this to happen to us and ouur beautiful planet earth? i know i don't, and thats why all around the world, cities and even entire countries are doing something about it, they are working on cutting back peoples' vehicle usage, or even eliminating it. without the cars, there would be a drastic decrease in pollution, peoples' physical health would improve, and no more stress.

we all use cars, it has become a daily thing for all of us. we have become so accustomed to driving that we don't even think about it. we never thought about just how much damage our cars were doing on our home, planet earth. cars are the leading source of pollution, everyday the pollution is ripping away at our ozone layer, slowly dooming us all and we are defiantly feeling the heat from it. places such as Vauban, Germany, have given up cars completely. in this experimental district, street parking, driveways and home garages are forbidden and, except for the main thoroughfare, the streets are completely car free. thanks to this, greenhouse gases in this area have gone down. residents of this town don't even seem to mind the car free life, they even enjoy it. having clean air makes this district a beautiful place to live in.

not having motor vehicles also can improve physical health. humans, especially Americans, have become incredibly lazy, and as a result, incredibly fat. no one has time in their busy schedule to excessive. everyone is too busy with work, school, kids, chores, or anythinng else. but, if we all got rid of cars and people either walked to and from their destinations, we would all be losing weight, be more aactive and be so muuch helthier. also, the helthier you are, the longer you live, so getting rid of cars will increase your life span!

having a car can also mean having a lot of stress. theres traffic backing you up making you an hour late for work, high gas prices sucking all the money out nof your wallets, expensive repair prices, and you are always putting your life at risk if you get into an accident. all this to think about while your just trying to get from point A to point B can be very stress full. but if everyone walked or biked to and from wherever, there would be much less traffic, no need for gas, the only repairs you would have to get is pumping more air in your tires, the onnly accident you might have is runninng your bike into another's bike and as long as you wear the right protectionn gear, you are very safe.

all of these factors add up to a safer, cleaner, helthier environment. if we all start now to eliminate cars, theworld would bbe a much bbetter pllace."
73783cf8,0,"Imagine this you're in a very populated city. Lets say New York, New York, U.S.A, London, England or any densily populated city for that matter. Now aside from the sounds of car horns blaring and the sounds of the thousands of people around you there is one thing that would most likely stand out the most to people the smell of car emissions mixed with the food street venders sell. Now they may not be a huge surprise but think about this, a city or suburb without cars. Now some may say that limiting the use of cars is a terrible idea and would hurt the working call citizens, but it may be better then you think. The reasons why these ""carfree"" places might not be so bad is it helps reduse the growing percent of greenhouse gas emissions that cars give off. You wouldn't have to deal with smog, and there wouldn't be as much noise pollution as there is with cars. Yeah these points may not seem like they are worth not having a car but there are comminties that actully don't allow cars because of those reasons. So maybe after this you may think a little differently about your car and may think about moving to one of these places that have alread choosen to go ""carfree"".

First off, probably like most people around the world you love your car, bt do you ever think about the car emission you admit into the air just driving to worl and back home. Now that does seem bad but, as shown in paragraph 5 of, ""In German Suburb, Life godson Without Cars"", an essay by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she writes that experts say the passenger cars alone are responsible for about 12 percent in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the U.S for greenhouse gas emissions. Now 12 percent doesnt seem like a lot compared to the 50 percent but that is still a lot of greehouse gases getting put in our atmosphere year after year.

Now think about this idea of a ""carfree"" suburb or city again. An example of this kin of place would be the city of Vauban, Germany. Now in Vauban drive ways and home garages are forbidden now car ownership is allowed but there are about two places to park. Now that place to park is a large garage at the edge of the development where as well as buying your house you have to buy a parking space for 40,000. Now because of this 70 percent of the families don't have cars and 57 percent of them sold their car to move there. Since there aren't car used here the air is much cleaner and because of not having little to no cars there they don't pollute the air.

Secondly, another reason to think about moving to one of the places is that there isn't any noise pollution from cars. Beause of the lack of car noiseses these suburbs and cites let you hear nature a little better and also allow a kind of peaceful feeling making these paces probably a lot more chill and ""sleepy"" in a since. making them good for people who don't want to live in a noisy city but don't want to live in the middle of no where.

Lastly, another good reason to move to these little areas would be that there is no smog there to make it harder to breath. A real world example of this would be from the informative essay, "" Paris bans driving due to smog"" , by Robert Duffer. Which basically states that due to nearrecord pollution Paris put a ban on driving to try and clear the air in the city. Now to help enforce the ban the put a 22euro fine31 if you where driving on a day your lichens plate was not allowed to drive. Now because some people did follow the ban nearly 4,000 people were fined and 27 people had cars impounded because of the reaction to the fine. Now because of this some companies complained about lost revenue and the transit of free of charge according to the BBC. And because of these efforts the smog cleared enought that the ban was lifted. Now that probably isn't very convinet but in carfree areas they don't have to deal with making it eariser to get to work on more accessible public transportation options like a bus or a bicycle.

Now think about this idea about carfree places one more time knowing what the benefits are compared to the risks you get. Maybe noe you just might look at these places a little more carefully and acually think about making a switch to live there in this greenhouse gas free, noise free, and smog free zone."
8f89a4be,1,"Dear Florida state senator, The Electoral College may seem like a great thing to have but I think it may not be the best idea. There are plenty of reasons and one of them is that it is kind of unfair that we really don't get to vote. We vote to see who is more popular with the people but if the Electoral College wants someone else, they can vote for the person they want. People think they are voting and no one else is making the decision for them but they are being lied to. It is an unfair way of voting and is is nondemocratic way in most people's eyes.

Although, most of the time the voters get who they voted for, it happened to not be that way one time. In 2000, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush won because he had more electoral votes and the people were angry. The Electoral College didn't go with what the voters wanted, but what they themselves wanted. People are being lied to that they have a say so in who should be president. Yes, most of the time they go with the voters but at any time they can disregard the popular votes and vote for who they want. If that's the case then no one should vote since they basically only have an opinion on who should be elected.

I said it was a nondemocratic way before and it really is. It isn't really a free way of voting, we give an opinion and the Electoral College votes for whoever. It fits back when America was just becoming America, but it is too old now. When the Declaration of independence was made and a little while after that is what time era I think it should have died out. It is other people voting for us. In America, we have a voice, we can state opinions, we can vote too, but the Electoral College votes for us. It is telling our opinion, it is telling who we want, but why can't we have direct voting? It just isn't fair to the voters because they aren't really voting, just expressing an opinion.

Speaking of unfair, the number of electoral votes each state gets is outrageously unfair! Why is it based on the number of people in the state? Why can't people just vote directly and not have to worry about how many electoral votes they can get? For example, Florida has 29, Texas has 38, and california has 55. They are all big numbers and they can easily make a huge impact on who becomes president. The less populated states on the other hand, don't really do much justice. Maine has 4, Hawaii has 4, and Alaska has 3. It seems really unfair to those states because they have a small chance of actually making any sort of dent in the numbers. Alaska's numbers compared to California's numbers is just really unfair. If people were able to vote directly, then it would be fair game for the states with fewer electoral votes.

In the end, people know the Electoral College is an unfair way of voting. People are lied to about being able to vote because it is not direct because it is the Electoral College decides anyway. The state numbers are really unfair, it is a nondemocratic way of voting, and people think it is way out of date. If the Electoral College were to trade spots with the voters who aren't in it, I'm sure they'd say that it is really unfair. People don't really get to vote, if anything, there should be direct voting like most people believe there is. It would be more fair for states like Alaska and all the other states with really small numbers. I'm sure it is easy to keep track of the numbers with electoral votes, but yet like I said, it is really unfair for the smaller populated states."
9d878bc1,0,"Transportation by a vehicle like a car is very common these days. It's an efficient way to travel for the most part, and has been used as an option for traveling since the early 1900s. Although cars have many upsides, they also have downsides too. By limiting car usage in more places, there could be many advantages. First, it could improve safety. Also, it will conserve resources. And lastly, limiting car usage will allow a tremendous decrease in pollution.

Limiting car usage will improve safety in a number of ways. By limiting car usage, there will most likely be a decrease in deaths since many car accidents result in fatality. It is not only cars colliding with other cars that is the issue it is cars having the power to destroy most things it comes in contact with. Cars are not toys but rather death machines. They have the ability to cause major damage which is why if limited usage is enforced, there will most likely be less accidents resulting in majorminor injuries or even death. There are many options for getting around besides using a car. For example, there are electric scooters, mopeds, skateboards, rollerskates, bicycles, and even good oldfashioned walking. While some of these could potentially be dangerous, they are probably not as dangerous as driving a car.

Another reason limiting car usage could be beneficial is the conservation of resources. Cars are heavy machinery and need an abundance of fuel to keep them going for years and years. What powers most vehicles currently is fossil fuel. Fossil fuel is not an everlasting resource and will be gone someday. Now there are some cars that run on electricity, but for the most part, cars around the world run on fossil fuel. Considering that there are about one to two cars per household nowadays, that would mean both cars are probably getting filled with gas or even being charged with electricity which could run your electricity bill through the roof. Since this applies to most people around the world, think of the resources being used daily. This usage of resources could be lessened by just limiting the usage of cars.

The last benefit of limiting car usage is less air pollution. Cars run on fossil fuel, as I stated in the previous paragraph. When a car is being driven, that fuel exits the car in a gas state. This gas form of fuel is very harmful to the environment. With so many cars on the road today, the atmosphere is already polluted a great deal.

Usually you will see signs that read ""No Idling"" outside of a store or any public area where cars are allowed which means that when you are parked, and are going to be parked for an extended period of time, you should turn your car off so that it does not let out gas. In Paris, a partial driving ban was actually enforced so that the amount of smog in the air would decrease. That is how much the usage of cars can affect an environment.

Overall, setting a limitation on car usage in more places can have benefits. It could improve safety, conserve resources, and allow for less pollution to the environment. With these reasons, I don't see many reasons for people to frown upon this idea."
f481569d,0,"Limiting your car usage has a lot of advantages. You can do so many different things with all the space and money you save. You can save money in alot of different ways such as not having to pay car insurance, or pay for tickets, or not having to pay for gas, and lastly not having to pay for you car when it broke down and need to be repaired. With the free sapce theres so many opportunities to build new stuff so that were making good use of it. In source one it says"" In this new approach, stores are place a walk away, on a main streets, rather than in malls arounf distant highways"". This is a good thing because parents wont have to worry about where their children are, and children wont have to worry about asking their parents for rides because everything is within walking distance.

Another advantage to not using your car so much is that it can clear the air and help get rid of pollution. In source two it says""... congestion was down 60 percent"". This is really good because if we did that everywhere there would not be a problem. When you use you car to much the air starts to change. In source two it says"" cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"", Which as you can tell is not good.

When we are not using are cars we can do alot of things. In souce three it says"" parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city ', This its telling us with out the cars people are becoming more active and spending more time with there famililys and this is always a good thing. another example in source three says"" uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks"", this is good because when you do use your car its more safe on the rode and its creating more jobs. In source three it also says""new resturaunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" which creates more jobs and makes more money for the city so they can betters school and give back to the community. Inconcluson cars are not the worst thing to have because it gets you from point a to point b but in between those two points theres alot of bad things that come with it i think we should just be able to inform people that we should use our cars more wisely and to some times leave the car to be with your family."
5c45240e,0,"Driving Everyones dreams when there're just hitting those teenage years. The day their parents hand them a key to their brand new car. We shouldn't live off our cars, we should be able to go anywhere we want and not worried to see if you don't have gas in your car, or if your license plate is expired. My fellow citizens there is many advantages of limiting car usage. Not being tense, not worried about the responsibilities on your car, and helps us to stop polluting the air.

To start, there are many places that don't have cars and their life keeps on going they are even stressfree. For example vaughn's streets are completely ""car free."" Heidrum Walter says ""when I had a car I was always tese. I'm much happier this way."" Source 1. Living without a car is not that bad. Living without a car can be much better for us. However the fact that living without car can be an advantage to us not everyone agress to the fact of it. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global cirty. congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. Paris typically has more smog than oter European capital. Delivery companies complained of lost reveue, while exceptios were made for plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Source 2. If the delivery companies and my fellow citizens can realize is that the cars that we so called center our development on is polluting our air causing smog in certain areas of the world, and you can see because Paris banned certain cars in its area the smog ended up going away. So instead of driving our cars everywhere we can use this to our advantages and limit our car usage, so we can prevet smog in our community and pollution in atmosphere.

In addition, good car less is a stress free zone. Business Carlos Arturo Plaza stated ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Which is absolutely true in my view because in Bogota, colombia a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombias hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Source 3. The car free day in Bogota and how people walked, biked, skated, and etc shows a great way to to take away stress. While you are either walking, biking, and so forth you have the chance to clear your mind and at the same time your not in a car that can pollute the air which can't result in smog. Also going car free is also becoming the new tread, a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, there has also been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license. source 4 I'm here today to show that this new tread that is spreading is one that we should take to our advantage and use it, it's making things better for us and also our communities.

To sum up, my fellow citizens we should limit our car usage. We all can enter this stree free zone together as one, we can help the place we all call our home. Don't be against it and just use it to your advantage. Going car free is the right way to go."
5c2f5c42,1,"Dear Senator, We the people, of the United States of America..... These are the first words written upon the Declaration of Independence. This is our very earliest document showing our democratic tendencies, and how we act as one. It also shows how we make decisions among ourselves as a people, as opposed to having other make decisions for us. This leads me to what I wish to discuss with you. Others do not vote for us. We vote for ourselves. We decide who leads us, who will help us get to a better place, who will decide what to do about the national debt, who will pass laws concerning immigrants and the minimum wage. We do. Not you, not the House of representatives, and most certainly not the Electoral College. Which is why there should be no Electoral College.

The Electoral College is a group of people whom elect the president2. How many for each candidate there are is decided by us, the voters. But heres the thing most voters think they're voting for the president. They dont even know what they're voting for! And even if some do, its easy to get confused and accidentally vote for the wrong candidate10. While one vote may not skew the entire election, a couple thousand can.

Many who support the Electoral College will say that voting by popular vote is a bad idea because of the possibility of a tie18. But in reality, it is just as easy to tie in the Electoral College. Its happened recently too, in 1888 and again in 200018.

This isn't the only thing thats broken about the Electoral College. The possibility that a president could win by popular vote, but lose the campaign due to the electoral vote is filthy. It is unfair to the people, and far from democratic. The Electoral College is an anachronism15. It reminds me of the Roman Republic really, and we are not romans, and this is not a republic. Or, at least, its not supposed to be.

Something else that is unfair to the people. Due to the Electoral College candidates only focus on large states, or swing states13. Voters in small states, such as Wyoming, will never see the candidates and may see only one or two camaign ads. They can't get to know the candidates and make an informed decision. And even in the regional states, democrats should always be trying to convert republicans to their side and vice versa. But because of the large swing states, this rarely happens.

The possibilty of corruption among the Electoral College, is also a present danger. I'm sure you remember form history class how party bosses took advantage of naive immigrants. I can imagine republican electors being paid off or threatened so that they vote democrat. Can you really trust the electors?

According to a poll in 2000, 60% of people want to activate a popular vote system. Popular soverignty worked well for awhile when it came to the topic of slavery, why won't it work for us now? And why would anyone want such an outdated system like the Electoral College in place? Think upon my words Mr. Senator. The Electoral College needs to end."
f837fc25,1,"Dear Senator, The electoral college has existed for many years till now and has been used to elect the presidents of the United States of America, clearly this form of electing a president is outdated. Senator, You must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because the electoral college is unfair, and irrational.

Senator you must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because it is unfair. This is true because under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a state senator who in turn elects the president. For example a person living in Texas that wanted to vote for John Kerry would have to vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would then receive his 34 electoral votes. Because of this system voters cant control who the electors vote for, and sometimes voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The electoral college isn only unfair to the voters but also to the men and women who are competing in the elections, for example in the 2000 U.S presidential race Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266 electoral votes. This is why you must replace the electoral college Mr. Senator.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is irrational to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on swing states. Seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign add. the electoral college is irrational because given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house of representatives can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people, and if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this senator in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophie. This is why you must replace the electoral college due to its irrationalism.

Its quite clear State senator, the electoral college is unfair and irrational, the best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. This is why you must abolish the electoral college."
c193f1aa,0,"Could you imagine what it would be like if we limited the usage of cars? We could save money on gas, who doesn't love saving money?! More money in our pockets means buying more items that are useful to us. And muse about how much pollution would decrease! We could all breathe in sublime air, clean air! Instead of huge car garages and parking lots we could save a lot of room, and use that room to build cheap houses for people in need.

Gas prices are hefty these days. They used to be a whopping 5 cents! Now they are around 2.90 almost three dollars! Could you even imagine how much money you would save a month? If you pay for 5 gallons of gas everyweek you would be saving around 60 a month! You could go out, buy extra groceries, have fun with it! I remember back in 2014 gasoline prices waged to 5 in some counties. Me and my father had to walk to our favorite stores, but it turns out that we very well like the sun beating on our skin, so we usually walk, and we rarely use our car unless we travel far distances.

Pollution will always be a big problem on Earth. We may not have cars, but we still have ships, and guess what? They can cause pollution, too! It would be so much better and healthier! if we all could breathe fresh air. If pollution were are main problem, ""plug in cars, and hybrids would be an exception"", as quoted in Paris bans driving due to smog.

Whew, I'm sweating thinking about how much excessive you could get if there were a limited usage of our cars! Everyone uses their phones, and sits on the couch all day long. How boring! You could go outside with your friends, walk to the mall, or walk to a store. Most of our daily life would be revolved around if we could move our feet. I walk to and from school, and I enjoy it, although the nasty gasoline smell and strange puff of smoke that comes out of the car I do not, and Heidrun Walter is with me. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way after she sold her car."" Being carfree wouldn't be so bad after all! Thanks to technology, we can breathe cleaner air because of hybrids and plugin cars. Pollution is deadly, I know no one wants to die this way, especially if it can be solved. Carfree? No problems."
aa458fc2,1,"There is a lot controversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the campaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have already experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic. We should remove the system of the Electoral College because it is questionable, problematic, and does not represent well our democracy.

The electoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and incentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the electors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. It only seems logical that voters should have a direct say in the presidential election by participating in an election by popular vote. This way, there is less opportunity for scandal and confusion in the voting process.

In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saughtafter swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. The Electoral College is proving to be less and less glamorous with every passing election. Slip ups like this can create a monumentally bad situation, and unfortunately, this system is only bound to create more.

Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office. This goes against a democratic republic way of opperating our country and, in many ways, makes it more difficult for cititzens to take advantage of their rights.

For as many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created by the Electoral College, there are certain things about the Electoral College that could possibly make it worth keeping. For instance, there technically is no region of the country that has enough electoral votes to vote a president into office, so no one area of the controls large numbers of votes. Along with this, the system helps avoid RunOff Elections which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner. However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change.

The Electoral College has proven to be more trouble than it's worth. Our country needs to decide what is within best interest for representation of our citizens, the most efficient way to opperate one of our most sacred constitutional rights, and maintain our democracy as members of our wonderful country. Remove the Electoral College system."
b9b58079,1,"A president election is great but, there are some difficulties along the way of deciding who will be able to vote. People are asking themselves whether or not they should keep the electoral vote or get rid of it and have a popular voting method. To me, the popular voting method is reasonable. I believe that you should get rid of the electoral collage method and change it to the popular voting method because its fair to the voters, YOU are able to vote for the president of your choice, and because of the winnertakeall system. You need to think about everyone in the all the states not just electing your president. Your people need to agree with the choice that has been made.

The electoral collage should be changed to the popular voting method because it is unfair to the voters. everyone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decide ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is not fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn around and vote for the other person. In Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" backs up my response when stating,""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.

With the popular voting method you are able to choose the president of your choice, not the president's electors. In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligible to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyone agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?

Another thing that is unfair in the election is the winnertakeall system in each state. People don't usually spend time in states they know the don't have a chance at winning. Who would? these states only focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Sometime around the 2000 campaign, apporximately 17 states didn't at all see those candidates. Even when there were voters in states that had 25 of the largest media markets, they were not able to see not even one ad from the campaign. This is being said in Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" For my conclusion this proves that there are many difficulties along the way of an election, regarding the votes and voters. With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method."
5ecde751,1,"Dear Florida Senator, I believe that we should not have the Electoral College no more. We are giving people false hopes that there vote counts when it really does not. We see on TV ads that we should vote and let our voices be heard but when in reality it is not. Didn't Lincoln once say ""A nation founded by the people for the people by the people..."" he was saying that we should let people have a a voice in everything that happens in America, but we can not even have a voice in who we wanted as president.

We give all the power to the Electoral College but not to the people. In 2000 Al Gore won the popular votes but lost the presidency. What type of system is this where we vote for who we want but get who we do not want. What the whole reason to vote if the Electoral College vote is more important then our. Beside voting for the president we want we vote for the slate of electors who elect the president. We don't even know who these mysterious Electoral College are they can vote for a president just because he is in the Democratic Party,we have no ideas why.

In 2000 we had the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse when it came to Electoral College. ""Consider that state legislatures was technically responsible for the picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The people vote was not heard in that year,because they wanted Al Gore representing by the Democratic Party but we got george W. Bush. I have never heard of a more unfair voting system before. Where were our rights the freedom of speech then, it was no where to be found. I feel that voting for who never we want should be in the Bill of Rights. So it okay to a gun for safety in our bag but isnot okay to vote for what we want.

On most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winnertakeallsystem in each state. Some candidates do not spend that much time in states they know they have no chance of winning. In 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not get to see george Bush or Al Gore these states were Rhodes Island with 3 electoral votes and South Carolina with 9 electoral votes. Candidates mostly only visit the states with the most like Florida with 29 and Texas with 38. They do not care about the other states they only care about who have the most electoral votes.

Each party selects slate of electoral they trust to vote for the party nominee and they have rarely been betrayed. It is could be true that the winner of electoral vote will not win base off of the national popular vote. But it is most likely not to happen again like in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes then Bush. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. So no Electoral can have a solid favorite they must vote on who would most likely chance America for the better.

But if the Al Gore vs. Bush happen once what stop it for happening again the reason why it happen was because we had Electoral College so to stop it. We Must stop it.

Florida state Senator as much of a good idea it is to have at some point in time it will go wrong. All good things, have bad endings. So I think it better to stop it now before things for the wrongs like Americans just stop voting becasue we all know our votes do not mean a thing when it come to Electoral College votes."
3dfb4c6c,0,"Of course, many people from all over the world are using cars for everywhere they go, however Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky agree that the reduction of the usage of cars will benefit us an abundant amount. Therefore, if we all used our cars less, it will benefit our health, benefit our financial problems, and benefit our environment.

Duffer and Rosenthal tells us about how using less cars will benefit our health. It would make us healthier by cleaning the up the pollution and smog in the air. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.."" 14 This is saying that people in France were becoming significantly healthier in just 5 days without the use of cars. Not only only does it make you less sick, but it reduces stress. It reduces stress because you dont have to worry about maintaining a car. ""When i had a care i was always tense. im much happier this way"" 3 This is saying that its less stressful not having car, and makes people happier. Health is a primary factor in our lifes and taking cars away puts us in a better position.

Rosenthal and Selsky tell us about how using less cars will benefit our financial problems. It would make us more money because they are not spending so much on gas, and components to keep the car in condition to drive. ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" 29 This is saying that people are not on the road alot, and if people arent on the road alot, they are not spending money. Not only does it save money on cars, but it helps you use other ways to get to places that arent expensive. It isnt expensive because people can find alternatives that dont need gas, and so much maintance. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countires, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday.."" 20 This is saying that because they dont need to use cars and there are differerent routes to take, the need to spend money on transportation decreases. Money is important to gets the necessities we humans need, so saving is a big deal.

Rosenthal and Selsky tells us about how using less cars will benefit our environment. It would better the environment because people will learn to communicate better. ""Likewise the rise in cell phones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of share can services for getting to work."" 35 This is saying that people learn how to share and to help one another out. Not only does it help communication, but it also helps helps people get outside and be active. It helps people get active because is they dont have cars, they have to keep themselves occupied or if they want to get to places, they have to walk, bike, etc. ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.."" 28 This is saying that that the city is working with the people to help make the environment a better place with no cars. The environment is an important factor as well because we have to take care of the place we live in.

In conclusion, Rosenthal, Selsky, and Duffer have shown that the reduction of the usage of cars will help us tremendously, and that having a healthier life, a greater amount of money, and a better environment will change the world."

1299cd27,0,"The automobile is a production commonly used by individuals all over the world. But utilization of this transportation vehicle arouses environmental damage as well as stress. Limiting car usage around the world would be greatly beneficial.

Limiting automobile usage would decrease hazardous rates of air pollution in regions at which cars are commonly driven. The tailpipe of cars release toxins, often produced by the automobiles fuel, that severely pollute the environment once in the air. According to experts, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50%...in the United States""Source 1. This amplifies the dangerous impact automobiles have on the environment. Paris, a carusing country, reached extreme levels of smog due to automobile emissions. According to Reuters, ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic matter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London""Source 2. Due to this, a ban was made on car usage and the smog eventually cleared. automobiles emissions of greenhouse gases are utterly harmful for the environment.

Decreasing the utilization of automobiles would also ease stress levels among the community. In Vauban, Germany, cars are practically forbidden causing the suburbs streets to be free of the persistent humming of a motor. ""When I had a car I was actually tense. I'm much happier this way,""Source 1 says Heidrun Walter, a citizen of the carfree city. This illustrates how the loss of automobiles can bring tranquility to a region. Bogota, Columbia hosts the Day Without Cars, a day where the driving of an automobile is not permitted. According to Andrew Selsky, due to this occasion, ""pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" and ""rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic""Source 3. Lowering the usage of automobiles would relieve individuals of density caused by driving.

Automobiles are an exemplary form of transportation but their impact isn't as beneficial for other purposes. Car emissions of greenhouse gases promote global warming and traffic only tenses drivers. Limiting the utilization of these vehicles would decrease if not diminish their negative impacts on the world."
2fe0b1f5,1,"Dear Senator, I know you have a lot of things on your mind, but I really felt the need to address the way we vote for our president of the United States. Instead of using the Electoral College, I think we should select the president by popular vote. We, the people should be allowed to control who our president is and that not always likely to happen. We can't control whomever our electors vote for. If you keep reading you will see my reasoning for not favoring the Electoral College.

First of all, I favor changing to election by popular vote because of something we might call the ""disaster factor."" Us Americans should consider the fact about how back in 2000, there was one of the biggest fiasco of the century because of the election process. Just think about how state legislatures can just pick electors, and those electors they chose can defy the will of the people. Even if we go back even further to the 1960's the segregationists of the Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones, who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Secondly, I would prefer that he election was decided by the popular vote because some people refuse to vote. ""These electors are called ""faithless"" electors. They refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" stated in souce 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, in paragraph 11.

Last but not least of all, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Only because of the winnertakeall system in each state. Because of this system, candidates don't spend time in states they know dont have a chance of winning. They mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Back in 2000, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all, which is not right.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I would rather have the decision to vote for our president by using the most popular vote. I feel that we don't actually get to make the decision of who our president actually is. I would like to say that the electoral college is unfair, irrational and outdated. All in all ,My opinion is that Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! Any way I really hope you take this in consideration, not just for me, but for the people."
6206d698,0,"Many cities around the world have already learned the benefits to limiting or getting rid of car usage. A few of these cities are Vauban, Paris, Bogota. These cities experience less smog and pollution.

People in the places that have limited car uses do not seem to mind. A quote from In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal explains how giving up their car has improved their live, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Cars do cause lot of tension and stress from being in traffic and having to deal it bad drivers on the road. Many people are already too stressed and anything that can limit stress is good for you.

In Bogota, Colombia the city has ond day that is carfree. This day people hike, skate, or used public transportation to get where they needed to be. Violaters are fined 25. The over all goal of this day is to promote different forms of transportation. Even though weather can be a factor it didnt seem to affect people.

Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky states how this is true ""The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" This quote also shows that people are fine surviving with out cars.

Paris banned driving for different cars on different days because of the nearrecord pollution. Moday cars with evennumbered license would be fined 22euros if they drove and the next day the rule would apply to oddnumbered licences. There were exceptions for cars that are plugin, car pools with three or more people, and hybrids. Robert duffer, the author of Paris bans driving due to smog shows how well the ban worked in this quote the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday"". This is a great example of how much pollution would be cut out if we stopped or limited using cars. Just one day with out everyone using cars and there was a difference in the smog amount.

Limiting car usage also will cut carbon emitions and help the environment. In The End of Car Culture the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal states ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" With a limit on cars, trucks, and other moter veicals greenhouse gas emissions will lower. America is already lowering it's car usage by it's self. People are buying fewer cars, getting fewer licenses, and driving less all together.

Over all the affect with giving up moter veicals and finding other forms of transpertation are very positive. People would have less stress, reduce in greenhouse gasses, and lower pollution."
2129c2a1,1,"Dear Senator, I know that you have many issues to think about and have a lot of decisions to make, but I think it the subject of the Electoral College is a very important subject for you to ponder. The Electoral College needs to be changed, we need to vote for the presidency with the popular vote. I believe that the Electoral college needs to be taken away because it's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.

First, the Electoral College should be changed because it is not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College. The people ar voting for the president, but not really. They are actually voting for a slate of electors, who then choose what candidate there electoral votes should go to. The whole point of a democracy is to let the people of the country have a say in who is in charge, but with the Electoral College this is not happening. The people are saying who they want for president but if the slate of electors does not agree, then the votes go the other way. This was expressed in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer. In the passage he says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes."" In addition, the Electoral College should be abolished because the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate. The Legislature is technically responsible for picking electors and theywould very well pick electors that are all against a certain candidate. Everyone says the system is so strong but is it really? The fact that a group of people opposing one candidate could be the electors for that state and could totally changed the votes doesn't make the system look so strong. Plummer adressed this situation in his passage, he stated, ""Back in 1960, segregationista in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. so that the popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy."" Finally, the Electoral college system needs to be taken away because it is very confusing. The whole system is just a jumble of different things. There are so many different steps and processes that tend to confuse the voters. When the voters get confused they often end up voting for the wrong candidate or making a mistake. If the voting system was just, the voters voted for who they pleased, then the votes were counted, then all the votes from states are added together, and then whoever had the most votes won, the whole thing would just be much easier. I belive that when the situation is as impportant as voting for our president, it should be as easy and flawless as possible. For example, when I was in seventh grade, I learned about the Electoral College in civics class. learing about the Electoral College was one of the hardest and most complicated thing I learned that year. How are people supossed to vote, if they have no idea how the system works?

In conclusion, I believe that the electoral college needs to be abolished becauseit's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand."
4b48fe30,0,"Taking a deep breath in a city filled with cars and buses, people would be inhaling all the emissions giving off by the heavy duty use of cars. Taking in smog is like breathing in dirt. Changes around the world are taking place to accommodate to the impacts caused by cars. In the twentyfirst century, cars are a must to get from place to place. So, why is it that there is a decline in the buying of cars? Well, the less usage of cars creates no smog to inhale, would promote alternative transportation, and the culture in this society helps create less dependence on cars which leds to a better environment.

First things first, around the world something known as ""smart planning"" is taking place. This is a movement to separate suburban life from auto use. One main reason this movement is taking place is to reduce emissions giving off by automobiles, that would soon lead to smog. According to ""Paris ban driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, which states,"" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This ban was necessary due to the over pollution cars create and because of it, air was able to become breathable again. Moreover, in "" Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, Bogota tells the goal behind the carfree day, which states, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Clearly, having a bus filled with residents is a better choice than having cars filled only by one or two passengers because one bus would not produce as much emissions than twenty cars.

furthermore, the less dependence of cars would promote alternative transportation. Having a city filled with people walking, riding bikes, and taking buses would allow a traffic free city. In Europe, cities are taking the step forward by creating a city where it is difficult to obtain a car. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, explains the main motive why cities are making it difficult to use cars, which is, ""Its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" This means, that by making it a struggle to obtain a car, it would help promote others to use public transportation or another method, which at the end of the day, would benefit the environment.

Last but not least, the culture of the world is constanly changing day by day. In the twentyfirst century, technology has taken over the lives of many. From apps to the internet, the changes are inevitable thanks to the breakthrough in technology. In ""The End of Car Culture,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University, explains,""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift."" Mimi is talking about the recent decline of automobile sales occuring which mean less and less people are buying cars. She believes the reason behind the decline is due to the culture in which involves technology. Moreover, she goes on to say,"" Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" Again and again technology proves to be a saving factor in this world to humans, and in this case it is saving humans from injurying the only home it has. With the easy access of calling someone up for a ride or searching up public transportation near by, allows the environment to be fresher and cleaner, as well as, it allows humans to interact with one another without having to drive to that person's house.

Movements take place to improve what seems to be a problem. It is obvious that the over usage of cars is a problematic case. Around the world, people are going around side by side, without depending on cars like they use to back a couple years ago. Improvements shown in places like Paris, shows how the limiting of automobile usage can greatly impact the environment to create a clean atmosphere. Not only would it help clear smog, but it would allow a stress free city from being populated by traffic jams and yelling individuals, who are experiencing road rage thanks to the taffic. A happier environment would be created when people are out rding bikes to places and walking with friends. In cocnclusion, the benifits of limiting car usage are as clear as water, it would reduce smog, promote other forms of transportation, and would help our culture by creating a happier, cleaner atmosphere to live in."
17c38d19,1,"Dear State Senator, I believe that something should be brought to your attention. I'm concerned about the way we are handling the current election process of presidency. You see, at the moment weus Americansuse the Electoral College. But it is becoming a major issue. I understand that ""the founding fathers established it in the Constitution."" But ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors."" Why focus all of our time choosing Electors, when we could be allowing citizens to vote directly for their President themselves. Office of the Federal Register states,""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors."" Did you realize that ""a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President""? We have millions of people in our country that could be doing the work themselves.

I understand that life is not always fair, but I do believe that as a State Senator you could use a hand. ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" They could use a helping hand as well! ""The presidential election is held every four years."" In those four years, American citizens wait eagerly and anxiously to choose a potential new president. Why don't we give the people what they want? ""Most states have a winnertakesall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation.'"" These complications could be avoided if we listened to what the citizens have to say and allowed them the freedom to vote for their president directly. America is the land of freedom after all, is it not Senator?

""According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" A recent article by Bradford Plumer says,""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best."
d981ee62,0,"Car's. relied on by many people. Used to go anywhere and everywhere. They are comfortable and cool to look at, but are they really as great as everyone think's they are? They pollute, they cause accident's, they destroy the environment and they cost a lot of money and sometimes it's more then people have. Yes, car's make everything easier for you but what happens when there is a bad traffic day and you are already late to work. sometimes car's arent always a great thing.

Gas. The first thing I think of when I hear about car's. They put so many toxin's in to the air that can kill everything around them. In the article it talk's about Paris banning car driving due to the fact that the smog or gas coming from the car's was becoming unbareable. Congestion was down 60% due to the fact that the smog had intensified. Beijing, China happens to be the one of the most polluted cities in the world due to car's. The fuel in car's is pushed out the exhaust pipe when the car is driving which then pollute's the air which make's it hard for thing's that need air such as the surrounding animal's, plant's and human's such as our self's.

Another thing that cause's problem's with car's is the fact that traffic jam's and accident's that are just waiting to happen at any moment. Someone who doesn't know how to drive very well hit's someone else and it cause's an accident leaving people hurt. Not to mention the stress and the road rage that driving put's on people. Going outside and walking to work or going to the park with out all the problem's of being stuck in a car and enjoying the fresh air is a great way to start any day. On the day that Bogota, Colombia decided to have a carfree day people had hiked, biked,skated,and walked. These are thing's that I'm sure people wouldn't have done if they were still allowed to still drive their car.

How would car's drive if they didn't have the road's that we build? How do the road's get there? They get put down where there used to be tree's and land. People destroy and take apart the earth and the put down road's and building's. What do people plan to do when they have taken down all the tree's and used all the space that the earth has to offer? There will be nothing left. Car's are great and all, I understand that they are fast and they make life simplier but people are getting lazy and they are starting to not care about their surrounding's and it's sad.

Car's are not cheap. They take time and money. When a car has a problem or break's down you have to pay to get it fixed. You have to pay to put gas in your car and depending on how much gas your car need's, it can put a hole in your wallet. Car's. We use them, rely on them to take us where we want to go, use them for entertainment such as Nascar and Monster Truck's. One day all the car's will be gone and then what will the world do."
7ac7862e,0,"Some people may view car limitations as bad or inconvenient, but that isn't true. There are plenty or ways to get to where you want to go other than driving. More people have been cutting down on their car usage and it helps with many things. There are lots of advantages to communities and cities when car usage is limited.

Pollution is a major problem in big cities like Bejing, China known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Cutting down car usage in big cities like this can help get rid of the horrendous smog. Paris, which often has more smog than other European capitals, has made some significant changes to help reduce the smog and harmful greenhouse gasses that are trapped in the air from car emissions. They let cars with even numbered license plates drive on some days and cars with odd numbered license plates drive on others. This reduced the smog in Paris within a few days.

Most people depend quite a bit on their cars. Reducing car usage can help people not to be so dependent on their cars. Instead of driving to work people can ride the bus, take the subway, etc. This will help a lot with the congestion of the roads during rush hours. There will be a lot less traffic if people are carpooling or taking some other mode of transportation, keeping roadways clearer for emergency vehicles and public transportation. There also won't be the problem of people being late if they get stuck in traffic or their car breaks down.

The number of miles people in America drive has gone down significantly since 2005. This means that people are finding better, more efficient ways of getting to where they need to be. This will help everyone in the long run. There will be less money spent on cars, car repairs, and gasoline saving everyone a lot of money. Cars can be very expensive to maintain, especially when no one knows if their car battery is going to die or if they will get a flat tire. Having another source of transportation would save people lots of time and money. If there is less need for cars, then more public transportation will be offered, even in places less populated like the suburbs.

Limiting car usage is helpful for everyone and eventually it will become even more efficient and convenient not to drive a car everywhere. Pollution will go down and money will be saved. There are already entire communities like the one in Vauban, Germany that don't rely on cars. If there were more communities like this around the world, they would help lead the way to a new age where cars aren't as important and people won't have to depend on them as much as they do now."
bed52766,1,"Dear Florida Senator, I think we should change our voting system to a popular vote instead of an electoral college. I think this should change because the electoral college has many flaws in it with the way it is done. The popular vote is much more reasonable and practical.

One of the main reasons that I believe we should switch is because of the ""Disaster Factor"". I think that this really stood out to me when researching. According to source two,""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" The author is onehundred percent correct. The state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and the electors can ALWAYS deny the will of the people. This would not happen with popular vote because the people's opinion translates directly to who they want as president.

Another reason why the popular vote is the better way to go is because you will never get a tie. With the electoral votes, a tie is possible because there is an even number of electoral votes across the United States. Also, not one citizen of the united States wants a draw because then the House of Representatives would have power and state delegations would vote for the president. The houses decision will almost certainly not reflect the real voice of he people.

My last reason why I believe that the electoral college is unfair to voters is because the swing state votes. If its a tight race all the way to the end and theres only a few states that need to make a final decision, sometimes a small state ultimately changes the end result of the presidency. With the popular vote, this would never happen. The electoral college basically says that some states are more important then others by giving them more say in who is president. Popular vote counts every single person as one.

So after reading my letter I hope you have come come to the conclusion that popular vote is by far better. Electoral College is just old school, not fair, and can cause stupid issues that can easily be avoided with Popular vote. Popular vote will never tie, let others choose who is president besides the people, and would never let a swing state change the destiny of the United States of America."
f7aa848d,1,"Dear senator, I am not in favor of the electoral college. The electoral college may seem helpful in some ways in terms of voting, but not entirely. Think of it this way you vote for a specific candidate, but you are voting without knowing entirely whether or not your votes are making a difference because you have no control over who the electors vote for. I believe this system should make modifications.

Our county has already had many problems, and accusations of having a corrupt government. Hearing about the electoral college system, and the fact that as a nation we have almost no power for who is elected, does not help the case of being called ""corrupt"" or ""incorrect"". The people as a whole in the United States should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, without worries. People who specifically vote for someone running for president should either be able to do it themselves, without having to vote for a slate of electors, or, the slate of electors should be more reliable. As in paragraph ten, we cannot always control who the electors cast their vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" Either the electors need to be more reliable in carrying out the requests made by the people of the United States, or we must make modifications to possible change or all together cease use of the electoral college system.

In addition to the fact the American people do not hace full control over who our electors vote for, we do not even have control over who our electors are.

In paragraph eleven, it states that ""legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" If you were truly in favor of protecting the rights given to the people of this country, you would notice this system is wrong. No control over our votes, and no control over the electors? Something must change.

Take into consideration how our country is affected every time a new president is elected. Sometimes this effect is good, others not so much. The popular vote should be able to decide who is elected for president because those who are voting will be effected greatly by the change in presidency. Popular vote means the vote cast the most, the vote submitted most, the vote a large majority presented. The popular vote is always at risk of being defied, and there is nothing the common people of the United States can do about it. There is no action we can take to change the election. In paragraph 16 of the article, it states that ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed..."" Yes this trust may rarely be betrayed, but it is entirely possible. Just because it does not happen often, does not mean it is impossible...and who knows? What if the trust is betrayed sometimes without our knowledge?

Finally, unless I have not made it entirely clear, I am not in favor of the electoral college system. Trust can always be betrayed, even if it does not happen often it can still happen without our knowledge. The people residing in the United States and under the laws of our country do not have full control on who is elected as president. I am, however in favor of election by popular vote. This means that a state casts its vote based on who the majority has voted for, and I truly believe this would system would best suit our country."
437bfa2c,0,"Most likely im in a car every day of my life and the odds are so are you. But What if cars were never invented how many lives would be saved? how much money could we save? And over all how much better and cleaner our world will be. These things are just some of the advantages that pertains to limiting our car usage. Have you ever heard of the good out weighs the bad? well in this situation the good defiantly out weighs the bad.

Our life source is breathing we need to breath air and at that fresh air, but we never are, not with fumes from millions of cars roaming around. Stated in source3 part ""Its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution"". That to me sounds like two gains already, whats better than fresh air and less stress. Things just as simple as car pooling makes the world better but what really would is not useing your car daily. No, i dont mean walk every where you could use bikes, electric operated golf carts which are all fun but much better for the air. By useing these we have fewer fumes in the air which makes for better air. If we all began useing these instead of cars in just towns it would become normal to ride bikes and, golf carts rather than big bulky air killing machines. For an example in source4 par29 ""Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". It just starts with one to make something drastically change. Now i know were not gonna take family bike trips all the way from florida to georgia or drive a golf cart that only goes to 40mph,but thats when it would be decent to make a ""car trip"". Im not saying stop useing cars completely just only when its not necessary. Just think about the world you live in the world that God has created is being polluted every day, but we can all change that.

Money, money ,money Seems to be the big talk in America weather its the money were making, the money were losing ,or the money we just dont have. But Wouldent you rather put your money towards the mouths of your family or the roof over your head, rather than in your gas tank ? Useing less cars would give us more money on more important things in life and, would cause more people to become happier. Just by useing things like bikes can make things more smoother in your every day life for an examplesource3 par28 ""Rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"". No one i know loves sitting or, nearly wrecking during traffic with this mehtod of less cars we could cut deaths and, stress in half. And i know you would say, but millions of people would lose jobs big money by car usage being reduced,but think of all the new things they could make their money from. People are always looking for the next big thing , well this is it. Dealerships that promote this could now turn into safer mobility shops and, make nearly as much. Stated insource4 par32 ""Americans could not afford new cars and the unemployed wernt going to work anyway"". This goes to show that were already leaning towards the idea of less cars we just need to be pushed. All the new inventions that will arise weather its cute bicycle covers to built in tops to block the rain people will be gaining and saving just as much. But what were really gainig is the saftey of people. Kids fall off their bikes everyday and probably get hurt but, a scrape is better than taking your last breath. We all gain from this , and our human nature is to want whats best for yourself, well this is surely better for every one.

Almost every day im in a vehicle, but maybe that could soon change. We could gain so much from losing just a little bit of driving time. We would absolutley gain lives,money,and happiness from useing less car usage. Im a firm beliver in useing this method i couldent imagine a better world of things going just so smoothly all of the time. But It takes getting on that bike or walking to the corner store to strike a revolution like this. So get out of your cars and, go make a better place for you and for the world."
9382bcfa,1,"Freedom to chose our leader is nothing more than an illusion. Voters have absolutely no saying in who shall take their place on the presidential seat. This is what the Electoral College does. It is an archaic system and unreliable system in which the whole of the presidential election is decided by the bias of the few whom are ""pledged"" to a certain party but at the end can choose whoever the like the most. This is not the Democracy we so dearly hold in our hearts like Americans and it goes well against the principles our forefathers taught us as free pople. Undeniably the Electoral College negates any concept of the democracy of America, making the impotance of the will of the people meaningless and nothing more than an illusion.

Deep into our history is the recaunting of how such a terrible system as the Electoral College came to be. It was originally a settlement on the dispute of how the president should be elected, either by the people or by Congress. Now the first option would have been the perfect one, but there are always those who would firts dei to loose their power to the pople of our country. And the clash of interest was so large it could have broken the nation in two as we have seen happened a few times in history. As such a great many years have passed since this whole argument and at every election poeple are realizing the faults of this flawed concept. At its core the system is Useless. It is the most antidemocratic idea ever to have been in practice and one that still is in use. It overpowers the will of millions with the will of a few hundred. That is why such a monster should be abolished.

The year is 2000. Al Gore and George W. Bush clash for the seat in the white house. The election draws to an end and the votes are counted. There is a clear discrepancy in the votes, making Al Gore the winner, and by all means, the next president of the United States of America. But somewhere else there's also a clear discrepancy. Back at the Electoral College the counting says Bush won against Al Gore even though Al had already won the poeple of America. On that election 5 pople choose the fate of an entire nation. 5 people only. Such a thing is outrageous, and we are lucky it hasn't happened again nor more frequently. But thing is it shouldn't happen at all. That's ehy the POEPLE should choose insted of 538 what'stheirfaces. This endevour proves one thing and one thing only.

Unreliability. It is illogical that one wins the masses of the common citizens but looses because of five well dressed ones.

The Electoral College is a monster. A wild dice which at one moment can favor you and at the next one destroy you. This isn't how America works."
939fa264,1,"I write this to the Senator of Florida.

Every four years a president is elected to become what is the Commander and Chief and sole representative of the United States of America. Because we as a country are a democracy, ""the people"" get to choose the president. We go every four years, starting at the age of 18 and so on, to vote or to choose who we want to represent us as Americans. Who we want to run this country. Who we want to lead us both to success and trust that they will do all in their power to keep us safe. But are we, the people, really choosing who we want? Just like President Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO, I believe that we are not choosing at all but we are voting for a state of electors, who in turn choose a president for us.

The electoral college is very unfair to voters.""according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore_ thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election...voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong By: Bradford Plumber If you wanted to vote for a specific president you would have to elect the state electors pledged to that president and hope they pick them. At times the electors have the right idea and other times the electors get confused and choose the wrong person. Other times the elector could even be biased or even racist in rare cases, and choose the one person that you do not see running this country.

""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During The 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" That is, because the electors are the ones that choose. The candidates don't even attempt to campaign in places they know they wont get a vote on. The candidates will try to win over the bigger states first to gain more electoral votes to win.

I see the electoral college as an unfair way for the people to vote for president. If we are truley a democracy, then we should change from using the electoral college to the use of popular vote, or direct election."
223bbf18,0,"When limiting car usage the first thing that most everyone thinks of is: ""How would I get from Point A to Point B instead of driving myself in my car? Would I walk, ride a bike, take public transportation, or try and find a new creative approach?"" Limiting car usage is not the end of the world, it is the beginning of a healthy one. Most cars burn gas which cause smog and pollution which is harmful to the environment, some people get lazy and end up being so dependent on a vehicle that they will not even consider walking a few blocks to a friend's house for an afternoon lunch, and our own ancestors have gone without a car for centuries on end. So would it really be that much of a struggle to not use a car any and every where that you go? You do not need to never use your car again, you just need to realize that using your vehicle more than needed is harming not just yourself, but everything and everyone you interact with in life.

In Paris, France a partial driving ban was put into effect just before the city of Love and Romance' reached record breaking pollution levels. The ban states that: ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following days.""""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer. However, just because there is a law put into affect does not mean that everyone will abide by it. According to Reuters, an international news agency in London, almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their vehicles impounded because of their reaction to the fines. It is a shame that people are so unwilling to follow one rule for one day which would help the planet and reduce the pollution in their city. According to Duffer, Paris ,typically, has more smog than other European capitals. When buffer's article was published he states, ""Last week Paris has 147 micrograms of particulate matterPM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Also, in Paris, diesel fuel is used more than gasoline. Diesel engines take more energy to burn the gas which causes more pollution than just normal gasoline. According to Reuters, France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In France, as a whole, 67 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. In the rest of Western Europe, about 53 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. The smog that is in the air from the burning gas of your vehicle ends up in your lungs. Imgine just sitting in front of the exhaust pipe of your car for a few secondsdo not actually attempt this analogy it is overwhelming and unbearable. It is harmful to your lungs and the rest of your body. That pollution is coming out of thousands and thousands of other cars and is adding up to the air all around you. You breath that air every day, just like your family and friends as well. In Paris, after the partial driving ban, on Monday the smog cleared up enough for the French party to take away the ban on the oddnumbered plates on Tuesday, according to Duffer. If the smog in one of the biggest cities in the world can clear up just a little bit in one day from limiting car usage, imagine how much smog could be prevented if you limit your car usage every day. What if you only used your vehicle when traveling out of town or when you need to transport a large item? You can change your whole environment just by deciding to walk or ride the bus to work instead of turning on your vehicle to drive 10 miles down the road.

The law that was put affect in Paris, France does not state that you can never drive your vehicle again, it is just simply asking the citizens to go one day without their vehicle. ""But what if I have to go somewhere such as work, school, or anywhere else that I want?"" Paris is a large city, that much is understood, because it is a large city there is more than just one way of getting from Point A to Point B. One way is public transportation from the city andor local businesses, like a bus or tram. According to the BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday as well. So, if you did not want to spend extra money than you had to that would not be a probolem. If you do not like public transportation, or do not prefer it, you can get out for a bit of exercise and ride a bike or even walk. Getting up or leaving maybe an hour or two early so that you can get to your desired destination on time is not that heavy of a price to pay. Also, you are getting exercise out of it which benefits your health. Walking or even riding a bike to work can benefit you in so many ways. If you see someone familiar walking towards you, you have the opportunity to start up a conversation and catch up with how their life is going. As well as this, if you see a small shop or stand that sparks your interest you have easier access to explore inside. If you were drivingriding in a vehicle then you would have to cross traffic, find a parking spot, make sure you grabbed everything that you need, and make sure that it is locked. If you are taking a stroll through town, you already have your needed things, you do not need to cross traffic and find a parking spot, and you do not have to risk accidentally leaving your vehicle unlocked and end up possibly getting robbed. A study discovered by Elisabeth Rosenthal found out that driving by youth decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe this is because young people still have the energy and sense of adventure in them to walk or take a bus somewhereor they just can not afford it, which in the long run saves them money anyway. Maybe you can learn from the young people that decide to ride a bike or skateboard to work instead of driving a car. Maybe taking public transportation is not as crowded and as much of a hassle as the movies make it seem. Taking public transportation can introduce you to new people with different backgrounds as well. You can meet someone that you might not see as a coworker or a family friend that you have an idea already who they are. Some people are always so busy with every day life that they do not have the time to meet new people and learn new names. With public transportation or deciding to walk instead you have a bigger opportunity to meet someone new. Why not give yourself a healthier lifestyle by walking once a week to work instead of driving? The question still remains, why not?

Limiting your vehicle usage does not limit your options and exposure to the outside world. Having a vehicle is not entirely a bad thing either. Some vehicles are 'eco friendly' and are built so they can help protect the environment. Sadly, however, most are not built and designed that way. Driving is so stressful for a person. You have to focus on all of your surroundings, check every blind spot, make sure that all of your fluids are not empty, replacing tires, and so much more. Again, driving is not all bad. Some people enjoy to drive, some say that is relaxes them and gives them time to think because driving is the only 'alone time' that they have. Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."
db3a2405,0,"Limiting car usage is a tremendous advantage. Haven't you ever thought why? limiting car usage has its reason why its an advantage. One of the huge reasons is pollution, cars tend to create pollution, congestion, smog and many other harmful things. Source 14 mentions useful information of the disadvantage of owning or driving a car. Source number two mentions how cars tends to create lot of pollution, for this reason in Paris they decided to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Nobody would like to live in a place where you have to be breathing dirty, contaminated air and knowing you produced it by your own car when Paris enforced to ban cars for a few days to clear out the global air not many fellow citizens participated about 4,000 citizen were charged with a fine for not following the rule. why would you try to be disobedient when what they are trying to do is help you clear out the global sir so the citizens living in that area dont get sick with any disease and dont harm our earth where we live. The advantage of limiting car usage will be creating less pollution to have a better global air. Cars aren't the only way to get to place to place there is other way to transport for example public transport like buses, train or even if its not that far walking and itll be a create exercise.

Yes, driving a car could sound great because you get to drive anywhere you want and get to places quicker instead of catching or waiting for a public transport when you need to get somewhere and your in a rush. Cars are a huge hand like a big help because it helps people get from place to place. Also remember that cars arent cheap at all an example is that source number one mentions "" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two placesto parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" What this quote is pointing out is that to be able to park a car if you own one it has to be in a specific place and which you have to own and live by there which costs lot of money. Limiting yourself for car usage would make you save up a whole lot of money. Instead of wasting like 40,000 dollars in a parking place for a car and have to be living there you can easily just get on public transport and be able to live where you want. source 1 also mentions "" As a result 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a to move here. when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this also points out the not many people in Germany dont own cars and not owning a car really doesnt bother them because they found better way to get a transport and also believing that Saving up money is a really important thing because when you become independ you have to start paying bills, food, and many other things that wyour parents wont give you anymore so why waste it on gas and car washing instead of just getting somewhere in a easy transport and the money you wouldve been wasting in nonsense now will be saved up for something more useful. thinking about it car limiting is a useful thing finacialy and global reaosns too.

Lastly another advantage of limiting car usage is less congestion the less driving there is the less traffic there will be. Traffic is a big headche to people who try to get to their jobs or certain events on time. Public transportion might ttake long to get there also but its becauise there isnt as much buses because not many people get on public transportion and the less buses there is and more cars who cause traffic the more time it'll take off our time. Source 3 states "" in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams."" Bogota, colombia has a great point doing this event once a year will demonstrate citizen that the less car usage the less traffic jams there with be and it will be more relaxing and calming area to live instead of hearing screaming, beeping and other annoying sounds caused by unpatient people. This event that colombia has done has cause other states to realize that thats a great idea and some tried experminting it in their country.

In conclusion limiting car usage has its great advantages which benefits the citizens living in that area so if it benefits you why not try limiting car usage. Limiting car usage creates less pollution, less traffic jams, and your able to save up your money for something thats actually important. Cars aren't the only way you could get from place to place theres many other options like walking, or riding a public transport theres always an answer to everything. By limiting car usage we create less pollution in the air we breathe and there wil be less harm done to the earth and to the citizens. Always try new things and let limmiting car usage be one of them."
5aa35c97,1,"We run our elections by a process called Electoral College. This process consists of tje selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Electoral College consists or 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.

There also is another process which is the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. We could change to popular vote but why would we change how we run the election if this is how we have been doing it for years. Also there are many other reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. Such as certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, Big states,and also avoid runoff elections.

A dispute over the outcome of an electoral Collge vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. Also the electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution. The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay more attentionto the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters.

It can be argued that the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. I believe that we should not change our electorial process to popular vote and i think we should stick with the process we have now Elecoral College. I listed my resonas why but the main reason is that everyone is so used to the Electoral College process because we have been doing it for years so to change it, it might confuse everyone and actual make the elections even more difficult and it might end up messing up our election and cause an unfair vote."
5598a0a8,1,"Dear or. Senator, I believe that America should keep the Electoral College to elect the president of the United States. I believe this because the Electoral College makes a guaranteed outcome, it gives proper representation to big states, and the president has to have a transregional appeal.

The Electoral College has more of a certainty of outcome for an election. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes a very convincing number but only 51.3% of the popular vote not as convincing. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of a tie in the votes. Even though the Electoral College has 538 votes, which would make it possible for a tie, it is very unlikely that there is a tie in the Electoral College. For example, Richard Nixon in 1968 only received 43% of the popular votes, but won 301237 in the Electoral College. Bill Clinton in 1992 had only 43% of the popular vote, but also won 370168. The pressure of a runoff election is reduced with the Electoral College.

The Electoral College gives the big states more representation than the smaller states. For example, Florida has 29 Electoral votes, while a state like Maine only has 4. In 2012, the popular vote was really close in Florida, but Obama won and got 29 electoral votes. If the same thing happened in Maine, the winner would only receive 3 Electoral votes. If America used the popular vote to decide who won, the win by a few votes would mean almost nothing, and the big states would have the same representation as the small states.

The president can't win the election by just winning one region of states. The Electoral College has made it that the candidate would have to have a transregional appeal. This is desirable for most people because a president that is only popular in one region, and not everywhere will not be a good president. This is why candidates don't campaign in places that they know they will win, and branch out to the swing states. These swing states basically decide the election. They are the states that do not favor either the democratic or republican candidate, so they have important votes. If swing states go one way, so will the election. This is why many candidates campaign in these Swing States.

As you can see or. Senator, the Electoral College is the best way to go for electing a new president. It has a more certain and guaranteed outcome than the popular vote, it gives more representation to the bigger states, and requires appeal from people all over America, not just people in one region."
94044ae2,0,"Cars have been the main focus of development for many years now. Engineers attempt to create sufficient cars every time a new model is planned. Many citizens of the United States are slightly aware of the environmental damage that is caused by the cars, yet still do no think twice when it comes to driving anywhere. Many countries around the world have set fines and laws against using cars and have seemed to produce a positive outcome. These countries offer many different alternatives to using cars, creating a well developed society.

While cars are a huge advantage to modern day society, they take a big toll on our environment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the Company, cars are the ""second largest source of America's emission"" proving how much we rely on cars source 4 paragraph 34.She also writes about numbers terrifying to the future generations. United States is responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe while Europe is only responsible for 12source 1 paragraph 5. 50 percent is proof that Americans are too reliable on transportation sources like streets, main roads, and highways. Paris was able to clear the air from pollution. According to Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune ,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog source 2 paragraph 10. Places in Asia like Beijing, China are just filled with smog in the air. The citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. That is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. There has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. Almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous.

Even though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. In places like the capital of Columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times , speaks of this matter. He claims that there has been ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" in the city of Bogota source 3 paragraph 27. Not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. It is noticeable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. In Barcelona, Spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. Other means of transportation like walking or bicycling have been the desired means of getting places. Even Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. There are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of Cars in the American nation.

With the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. What Americans hate the most are traffic jams. Think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. Millions in Columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty source 3 paragraph 20. The citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. When going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. France experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them source 2 paragraph 14. This leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. It also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles.

Many nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. In result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. Not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come."
6e0a24d2,1,"Dear State Senator, I am writing you a letter in regards of the electoral college. I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United states. While it is a good system, it is not reliable and does not let the people truly decide who their representative will be. It does bring some certainty of outcome but not as much as it should.

The electoral college must be abolished because it does not let the people truly decide who their president will be. While it does allow them to vote for a slate of electors who then elect the president usually based off of the popular vote, they do not always vote for who they are supposed to. The slate of electors that the people vote for are supposed to be trusted to vote for what the popular vote says, they do not always do so. A good example of that is in 2000, when Al Gore ran against George W Bush. Al Gore won the popular vote nationwide over Bush, he still didnt win the presidency because the electoral college did not stay true to their word and voted for Bush. That is because, as shown in Source 3, paragraph 15, "" When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. So while you might think your individual vote makes a difference, it doesn at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate.

Although the electoral college does bring better certainty of outcome than a popular vote, it does not have the certainty it claims to have. In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaigning is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.

So because the electoral college is obviously unfair, it should be abolished. Because the voters are told they decide who reopresents them, yet they do not. There is a possibility, while slim that a president could win the popular votes, yet lose the election because of the way the electoral college is set up. So because it unfair to the presidential candidates, it should be abolished and we should have elections controlled by popular votes."
b7a92ebc,0,"Global warming is one of the main reason, maybe the only reason the is destroying the atmosphere. Humans today are trying to prevent global warming because if we continue to pollute the atmosphere it can very well kill most of the living things, maybe all of the living thing on this planet, including humans ourself. I think reducing the usage of cars today is a great way to stop global warming.

One of the countries that are taking action in doing this is the countries is France. Paris has decided to partially ban driving to clear the air of the global city. In the text it states that, ""on Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their car at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31."" This show that paris is trying to get rid of the smog in the air, and now they are asking their citizens to stop driving their cars, bike etc. Also if you don't participate in you will have to pay a fine of 22euro. In addition one of the main substances to motor pollution is diesel fuel. the passage says that, ""diesel was the blame, since the France has...a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" Since France favors the usage of diesel, this one of the main reason why they have forbidden the use of motor in paris. Moreover it states that""diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of the Western Europe."" This again also proves that diesel plays a major role in the pollution of France. As you can see France is making changings to there country due to the global warming.

France is not the only one that has taken action by reducing the car usage. The city BOGOTA, Colombia has also changed their ways in cutting down on car usage.""Millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" the text states. What this is trying to explain is that Columbia has a program that prevents the citizens from using vehicles, so the whole day they usa bikes, skates, and take the bus, even some of them go hiking to wherever they go. Consequently there are some benefits to having a car, such as basic transportation needs. In the text it states that,""but America's love affair with is vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily.""Although driving is something essential to human needs these days, it is also very killing. As you can see other countries have taken part in this struggle to prevent global warming to get any worst.

In conclusion the reduction of using vehicle today can be one big step in slowing down the rate of global warming, although taking away cars me be a major problem to in basic transportation needs, it is better than killing everything on the planet."
f8d57f7a,1,"Dear state senator, Ever since 1776, The United States of America has been a great example of freedom, excellence, and democracy. After all, the U.S. is one of the biggest supporters of democracy, and is all about the rights of their people. So imagine my shock to learn that this country, in fact, does not rely on it's people to vote for their leader. Which, to many people would be the simplest form of freedom out there. Instead, we have the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a number of electors that represent a state. ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register In this quote, it explains that the Electoral College is based on the existing population in your state therefore, the more people you have, the more electors the state receives. However, this sounds great and all, but in my opinion, a direct democracy would work great for this country because it would generate just representation of the people by allowing them to make the vote, encourage voters and remind them that they have a voice, and immediately destroy the chances of a representative to vote for an opposing candidate.

America is all about their people. And of course, the government wants to do what's best for them, right? Voting is a right that American citizens achieve when they reach the matured age of eighteen. It's supposed to feel like a blessing that we get to decide and have a voice in the process of election. But, with the Electoral College, it ""...may turn off potential voters of a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner So the citizens of this country are beginning to feel like their say in this decision will have little to no impact. This will affect the amount of voters and will ultimately cause a huge problem in the way people feel about representation.

Enough about the people, how about the electors? ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer This means that not even when the people vote for all their electors and they should be selecting the correct candidate, they may change their minds. Electors are people too, and people may have their opinions swayed and then the electors could vote for the other candidate. It is scary to think that the candidate everyone chose and was rooting for might not win because someone decided to make a different decision.

And some people might stand up for the Electoral College, say that ""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates...to focus their campain efforts on the tossup states."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner It later goes on to say that because of this, the citizens in the Swing States become the most thoughtful voters because they receive the most information on the candidates. However, wouldn't we, as a country, prefer all of our potential voters to be informed and wellaware of our candidates? ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states...focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer Why should the fate of the presidency be laid in the hands of such a small amount of people when our country is meant to be for everybody in the land?

As a concluding statement, senator, I want you to consider my argument that we'd be better off without the Electoral College because citizens should be able to decide who they want to run, they should feel important, they should all be wellinformed, and electors that change their minds wouldn't even be a problem anymore. Thank you for taking the time to consider my letter."
934b4465,0,"The most basic and persistent form of transportation that has been around for centuries has been the use of cars. Hundreds of thousands of people use automobiles to get to their destinations in a quicker and more efficient way. Recently, all over the world, places like Germany and Paris have been rethinking their dependency on cars. Ongoing issues regarding pollution and stress have all been traced back to using a car daily. By limiting everyday car usage, greenhouse gas emissions, constant road rage, and lack of space for other recreational purposes will decrease or even be eliminated.

Pollution and global warming is a growing problem that has been affecting animals, people, and the air that we breathe. Slowly, the polluted air is becoming more and more infected. Cars and their tailpipe are a main contributor towards this issue. Studies have shown that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in the United States"" Rosenthal 1. The gas that is being released into the air does not have any way of being recycled. With a large amount of gas being released daily, the air can quickly become polluted with toxins and gas that normally is not used in the human body. In Paris, the intensifying smog caused a buildup of car traffic, which ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" Duffer 1. Also, Paris had been found to have more smog that the other European capitals had, ""last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London"" Reuters 1. This was purely because of the amount of cars, scooters, and buses that Paris has roaming around the cities. The decision to ban car use for oddnumbered license plates cleared the smog that prevented the drivers from using their cars.

Road rage is common in drivers that constantly have to deal with pedestrians, other cars, and the amount of traffic lights on the streets. The instinct to yell and become angered while driving has developed and grown into stress that affects an average person. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, has ditched her car and resorted to using her own two feet as her way of transportation. Walter says ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Instead of having to hear honks and beeps from incoming cars, she is surrounded by the calm streets filled with bicycles, wandering children, and the occasional automobile. Being a part of the suburban neighborhoods means that a quiet and serene environment is typical and common. Therefore, being thrusted onto the busy streets may be an enzyme to stress and road rage.

Recreational areas, such as parks and shopping centers, are a way of allowing people to relax and enjoy their free time. However, buildings are being demolished to make rooms for new highways and roads to allow for more efficient ways of traveling for the excessive amount of cars that there are on the streets. There are attempts being made to ""make the suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking"". Also, stores are beginning to be placed on a main street, instead of in shopping malls alongside highways Rosenthal 1. These ideas take away from living spaces and create difficulty for those who want to go into a store. In Bogota, Columbia, Mayor Antanas Mockus has created a program that bans cars for the Day Without Cars. This day is part of an idea and campaign to reduce stress and air pollution. Since this day began in the mid 1990's, ""parks and sport centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have been dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Selsky 1.

Since the invention in the 1800's, cars have been depended on to take one or more people from Point A to Point B in a safe and fast way. For centuries, that has been a reasonable form of transportation. But as air pollution is increasing, drivers are becoming more angry, and land space is being taken up by new roads and streets the idea of cars is being frowned upon. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from a incipient shift in American behavior..."" Rosenthal 1. Limiting car use allows for a healthier environment filled with other forms of transportation like walking, biking, and etc. Countries are beginning to form bans on cars forcing fellow citizens to lower their car usage. Last year, Bill Ford created a business plan in order to change America's way of transportation. He vowed to adjust future and current cities in which, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"", eventually creating a better world for generations to come."
fd15fd9c,0,"Cars have become a part of everyday life over the years. We depend on them for transportation from one place to the next. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live without a car? Well, globally, changes are being made. There have been car bans and even a community that completely quit using cars. There are advantages of limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage can lead to a less stressful life. The residents of Vauban, Germany, have taken a huge step. They have given up their cars. As stated in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"",70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars. A statement from a local resident, also found in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". The limit on car usage has allowed the residents to go back to a simpler life. A life where everyday noises such as children playing and bicycle wheels rollingalong the pavement can be heard.

Limiting car usage impacts the environment greatly in a positive way. The article titled ""The End of Car Culture"" states, ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"".Cars are a leading cause of air pollution around the world. For example, the smog in Paris, France, had gotten so bad that they had to put a temporary partial ban on driving. Due to this rule, congestion was down 60 percent. Cutting back on the usage of cars would have an incredible impact on global air pollution. A simple step in the right direction can change the environment is a positive way.

Being happier and decreasing air pollution are only two advantages of limiting car usage. There is a lot that can come from taking cars out of our daily routines. It may be hard to adjust at first but the impact it would have on the earth would be worth it. Taking responsibility and care of our earth is a change that needs to happen. Itis a possible and reasonable solution to our pollution problem."
cad31d61,0,"Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potentially become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go ""down 60 percent... after fivedays of intensifying smog."" This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. additionally, limiting car usage can push more people into exercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians ""hiked, biked, skated..."" during their carfree days source 3. Also, many ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city"" source 3. With an increase of exercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.

furthermore, lowering car usage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a carowner may ""buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home source 1."" Normally, a decent size house is approximately 100,000 to 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said ""I'm much happier this way source 1,"" because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stressfree lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.

The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow."
53393dbd,1,"Every 4 years, the first Tuesday in November. When its time for it, president elections is one of the most hectic times of the year. But what should the winner depend on? Electoral College should be removed by the government and just have popular vote be responsible. Electoral College can have electors go on the opposite candidates side so they lost a vote, which is just wrong. This argumentative essay will argue why Electoral College should be taken out by government.

One may say that Electoral College is the best system for voting, but then again that may just be the cheaters. Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one candidate win, is right. ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..""Posner. So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

Even though there are people who support the Electoral College, there are many people who are against it. In source three, Posner states ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.""If one has gone through an election, theres a long process and hassle of being able to vote, but if people go through the craziness to vote, why not make the vote count?""""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.""Plumer, paragraph 11. Not only are voters wasting their time to vote but the electors cheat. For example, if one candidate has the urge to win, they will send one of their electors to be on the opponents side so the opponent loses a vote that they believed would be theres. Electoral College also may not be fair to those in a small state. ""a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."", as said by Posner. Its not fair that even the people who vote from a small state, won't really get recognized because there are bigger states to overrule, and even then, the electors will still choose who they desire. Electoral College is an unfair, and a cheating way to vote.

To conclude the argument, Electoral College should forsure be removed. Citizens favor popular vote over an electors vote. Candidates and voters enter a whole different threshold to express their political preferance. Why should the government even have voting if there really not truly being seen in the correct way. Citizens want to take a stand and vote in what the mind believes in. Take out Electoral College, and let the voters vote, actually count."
d4c08431,0,"Car, bikes, walking and such are many forms of transportation. Cars are the main favorite overall. But as time continues we see that the drastic need for cars is growing smaller and smaller because we are now seeing the bigger picture limiting car usage is a bigger plus than a negative.

In Vauban,German the suburb is going ""carfree"". Rosenthal speaks about how Vauban allows cars but there are only two locations where they may park these cars. If you want to park your car you must buy a space for 40,000, and a home along with your parking space. Due to these facts 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. An advantage of this limited car usage is that people like Heidrum Walter speak about how she is much happier and less tense without her car.

Vauban is in an area that is more accessible to public transportation and closer to stores. The closeness allows people easier accessablity to buses, or walking and biking places. With everything close its easier to get to point A to B. Also reduces pollution and greenhouse gases due to the fact they aren't using cars to get to there locations.

In Source 2 Duffer, speaks about how in Paris bans are being placed against the usage against cars, due to the fact Paris has a high level of smog. Paris had motorists with evennumbered license plates on Mondays leave there cars home or suffer a fine. On Tuesday motorists with oddnumbered license plates were to leave cars home or suffer a fine. The advantage of this ban is that having so many people leave there cars home on Monday allowed the smog to clear enough that the ban for Tuesday was rescind. If Paris were to do this ban for a couple of years there smog issue would be completely gone. This would be a major advantage for them, it would give them less pollution, not as many people getting sick due to the smog, and a less car dependent city.

An event was created in Bogota, Colombia called A Day Without Cars. Which was to have people go carfree for a day. Colombians used many other transportations such as biking, buses, and hiking. This event allowed smog to be reduced due to the fact Colombians could not use a car this day or be fined. Also this event helped spark other areas want to pertake in this event. This was a huge advantage having many other places join A Day Without Cars this meant more areas helping reduce smog and helping many more areas become aware of the fact cars dont have to be the only form of transportation people use.

All in all if areas become less car dependent, there shall be less smog, pollutions and lastly people wont have to travel as far due to the fact everything will be closer. The smaller amount of cars we have, the more positive outcomes."
3ede07a8,1,"Dear or or Ms Senator, Presient Richard Nixon, and President Bill Clinton both have something in common they won their residencies with the Electoral College, not the popular vote. According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Paragraph 22 Richard and Bill only won 43% of the popular vote against their opponents while they were running for office. This is why the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of switching to the popular vote for the elections.

Now you're probably wondering, does high school students even know what the Electoral College is and what it's job? Yes, high school students do know what the Electoral College is and what it does. The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors. Your state amount equals one member from the House of representatives and two from the Senate. The electors are chosen from the candidate's political party. The Electoral College decides the president and vice president every four years every Tuesday ater the first Monday in the month of November.

or or Ms Senator, the Electoral College needs to stay instead of the popular vote because when you have the Electoral College you will get an outcome from it unlike the popular vote. Almost all states have the ""winners take all"" method which according to ""What is te Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal register Paragraph 7 this method is when all electors are awarded to the presidential candidate that is winning. Also the popular vote overrides the popular vote. In ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner paragraph 18 the 2012 presidential campaign for example it was the battle between Mitt rodney who is a Republican against Barack Obama who is a Democrat. Obama received only 51.3 percent of the popular vote and Obama got 61.7 percent of the Electoral College. As you can see the Electoral College overrided the popular vote which ultimately made him president. Also in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden"" Paragraph 22take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States.

To continue on, the Electoral College should stay instead of the popular vote since one region of the United States doesn't have enough power of the Electoral Votes to make a presidential candidate win. Look at ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Mitt rodney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidential candidates have to say since they are tossup states. These swing states literally can ""swing"" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidential canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen.

On the other hand, according to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" Parargraph 14 the Electoral is outdated, irrational, and unfair. In ""The Inefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer key names such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, AFLCIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerece all want to get rid of the Electoral College and use the Popular Vote. Look at the presidency that was in 2000 with Al Gore against George W. Bush. Al Gore would have won the election if the election was based on the popular vote. He won the popular vote with over 60%! But unfortunately, he didn't win and lost to George W. Bush since Bush won the Electoral College votes. But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the ""winners take all method"" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.

Ultimately, or or Ms Senator, the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of the popular vote because you will always have an outcome and one region can't overpower another and make a candidate win the presidential campaign. Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people."
e495cc9c,0,"Have you ever thought about what your life would be like without a car? May of us can't even seem to grasp the concept. So many America's are too dependant on their vehicles but, other placesacross the world such asGermany, Paris, and Bogota have began working on this new concept. I strongly support the idea of no car usage, just think of the benefits that could come from it, conservation of resources, lowered pollution,improved safety, and just think of all the money you would save without a car. The possibilities are endless.

Pollution and bad air are problems we face all around the world, and cars have much to do with it. ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" Source 4: The end of Car Culture. Intense pollution andbad health are problems that are faced all around the world, imagine the positive effects we would see not only in our environments but in our own selves if we stop car usage. We need to protect the world we live it by keeping it clean, also keep ourselves healthy in order for survival.

Many families lose loved ones every year due to vehicle related accidents, cars and traffic have a good percentages of deaths each year. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France, after fivedays"" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog. congestion has to do with traffic, adults complain every day about traffic and how dangerous it is. ""It's a good was to take away stress"" Source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. We spend a lot of our lives stressing over many things, why add the stress of traffic and wrecks? We have many more important things to spend our time worrying about, we shouldn't stress over something that we can live without. Taking away vehicles would wipe out stress, traffic, and many deaths a year.

financial problems aren't a forgein subject. Almost everyone can recall a time in their life either when they were facing the problems themself or heard about a close friend or family member going through a tough time. ""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" Source 1:In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. Not only people but countries have been guilty of putting cars infront of other neccessities. Many young adults will base their finances around a car of their choice when we all know their are far more imporant bills to be paid. Also, with taking away the centering of cars we have time to face and solve more imporant issues. Taking out cars would give people a chance to get their priorities straight.

This is why I strongly support the idea of no cars, I see nothing but positive results that would come and many other would agree. Improved safety, lowered pollution,improved safety, and money savings are just the beginning. I understand most can't imagine life without their vehicle but change isn't always a bad thing, especially when there's many factors at stake."
ad1dac3c,0,"Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone would have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about safety because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce lot of problems we have, and stress.

To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amount of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say ""So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?!"" no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it.

Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say ""We can also just stop teens from driving.."" well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amount of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be lot safer for people to drive. Sadly in lot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 34 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amount of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amount of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more.

We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 1020 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away.

To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce lot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned lot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything."
745b9080,0,"Statistics show that when a community has given up the use of cars that the amount of polution will go down, excessive levels increase meaning weight problems will go down, and in addition to this, there will be an increase on all round living environment and secure a higher quality of life for on coming generations. Why go through all this frustration when the alternative is so near to us. Its simple we don't have to.

Polution is a huge problem in this ever growing world. Its not solving any thing nor is it leaving things better for our new generation ton come. In places like Paris, Bogota, and Vauban Germany these few innovative pioneering societies have given up the past ways of driving and have looked on to better pastures. They have reduced polution, the ever growing smog and the reliance that man kind has found in automobiles. having a over populace of cars in one place or country can be the game changer when it comes to polution increase if we would just deal with these few over populated areas we would reduce this global warming affect. 12 percent of passenger cars in europe and 50 percent of cars in the US are responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions.

As well they have a no unnecessary congestion, or disruption of the peace of their homes. All this allows them to have a high Quality of living they get more excessive time seeing that they walk every wher. This is solves the huge population of growing obesity in modern countries. In places like Columbia there was a huge decrease in polution, on a carfree day. Millions were seen biking skating, hiking, and taking the local bus to support the new idea of carfree societies.

When living better it's just as important to excessive as it is to to have a clean and stress free environment. The every day problem of missing the bus or getting to work to late is a huge hassel to deal with. Your problems would over with out the use of cars this ensure the percentage of stress to decline. I'm not promissing a life care free but if if it can help why not. ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air polution,"" a direct quote from a man who has this carfree life. Yes real people are doing this and Yes the results of it are positive. 94 percent of perticipants have agreed that there quality of life now is better than before.

Its not a hard choice to make we either live in this world the way it is now and watch it come to a end, or we make the change that we want to see in it so tommorow I'm asking you instead of driving to work alone take a bike to work with a freind or simply reduse the affects and ride with a bunch of friends or take the bus. Its up to us to see that this world is taken care of so help me to the change."
25939bac,1,"Greetings Mr. State Senator, Looking over the Electoral College, there has come to be a few interesting details. Yes, the process is beautifully thought out but as we look at it deeper it has its flaws. The founding fathers have given us the Electoral College, which anarchist are very unappreciative veiwing it as a nondemocratic way to vote.

If the Electoral College system goes, then Americans can have their full Constitutional rights. Using this process voters are not voting for the electors of their choice, voters are voting on higher qualified voters to vote for the electors. The whole process is a violator of the amendment entitled to voting. Having this maze of voting for voters, what if a voter confuses of who the electors is voting for so their vote isint actually going to the candidate of their choice. In 1960 before the election of John F. Kennedy, the segregationists of the Louisiana legislator came very close to replacing all of the Democratic electorss with electorss who opposed John F. Kennedy. So all the voters in favor of JFK. will be voting against him and all the Electoral College votes would be going to the other candidate.

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defences are wrong , ""At the most basic level, the electorsal college is unfair to voters."" Plumer makes a very valid point beacuse of the size of states. The electorsal College's number of representatives are as big as their states population. So if all of the representatives in Alaska vote on the Republican candidate, and most of the people in California vote for the Democratic candidate, the Electoral College vote in California overules the vote in Alaska.

The Electoral College can make some voters not want to vote, usually because of their state size their vote doesnt count as much. Many voters in larger states refuse to vote because their vote wont really change the Electoral Collage's vote. The voters don't have total control over an electors, so the whole election crisis could happen again.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may have worked when the colonies were small and the votes counted, but today the modern society doesnt appreciate its lack of Constitutional rights. All we ask is for our right to vote to be given to us, so we can take part in our government."
e4b1ed5f,1,"Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the presidentSource 1. This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. Some say the electoral college is good because it prevents ties or because it will make sure there is a winner. But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president? I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished.

There is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it's your decision? In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush insteadSource 2. This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college!

Some others may say that they support the electoral college because it can't have a tie. ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state.""Source 3. It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a slight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.

""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""Source 2. This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each candidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" politicians that can over rule the entire country's vote. It's ridiculous how the system works and you are crazy if you support it. I know i want my fair share of input and the electoral college won't allow that.

There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids runoff elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...""Source 3. In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people.

In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is."
c8505f9b,1,"Dear Mr.Mrs. Senator, The Electoral College is a process created by the founding fathers of America to choose a president by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I believe this is not a very effective process. I think that we should go to popular vote because it allows the citizens to have a vote and it is not up to people that alread run our country and it allows the president to be chosen fairly.

To begin with, the electoral college is not a good idea because it allows citizens to have a voice and it is not decided by people that already run our country. If we resorted to this method, there might be a higher voter turn out because the citizens will feel that they really have a say in who runs the country. They won't think that if they vote for one person and they win, that some lousy people in Congress will come in and make a different decision and go against the majority. This will make more and more people want to make a difference in the country. Then we will have more concered citizens and the U.S. will be a better all around country. As stated in Source two, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" That fact is why we should absolutely not have an electoral college. Then if we don't have an electoral college then we will have a higher voter turn out. Then after that, the good ole USA will be a better country than all of the other countries in the world combined except for our health and education. That is just one reason why should not have an electoral college.

Additionally, we should not have an electoral college because it will then allow us to chose the president fairly. With not having the electoral college vote on a president, it would make the voting system more fair and not based on a few people. Then when people try and figure out if they will vote or not, they will think, ""hey, my vote does matter because there is no electoral college to spoil my vote!"" This would make for a much better run country because the citizens have a voice in the government. The only reason a citizen would not vote would be if they were critically injured or they didn't like any of the canidates. This is just one of the many reasons why we should get rid of the electoral college.

In conclusion, we should get rid of the eclectoral college because it would give the citizens more of a voice and it would make the voting process more fair. This would make the government and the country run smoothly and a lot better than if we keep the electoral college.

thank you for your time Mr.Mrs."
e5edee6d,1,"With the years, we have changing many things in our society. Since technology, by making new electronic devices, to things in our government, by making new laws and new things to help people in all the country. But, does that mean that we have to change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States? In my point of view, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution. And there are many evidence to support that keeping the Electoral College is beneficial to our country.

According to the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, and it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of rodney. Almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote vistory in that state. This demonstrates, how people accept the fact that they are voting the electors and then for the President and Vice president. This help people by making easily the hour of vote for a candidate.

However, as we can se in the texts above, not everybody things like this. For example, in the text ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, the author says that according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. But, each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. Posner, paragraph 16.

Another evidence from the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, is when he says ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"" Posner, paragraph 19. That means that No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavely in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing huis plurality in states that he knows he will win. ""The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" That highlights how the Electoral College is trying to helping people vote their candidates and feel safe and comfortables with them.

To conclude, despite the fact many people say that the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism and a nondemocratic method of selecting a president, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution that helps our community to help people with thir desicions and make our life more comfortable and easy."
97d24cb5,1,"To the senator of florida, I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposedly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.

Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an favored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallop poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.

Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly proffered president according to source 3, there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occurred in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without ""establishing a president"", though it can happen again.

We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college."
0b3f580c,0,"Are we using cars too much?

In Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog , "" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because that we use cars too much, we are creating pollution that is basically driving the planet we live on downhill. There is a way to change this. Limiting car usage, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

Life can go on without cars. In VAUBAN,Germany a community has created a carfree city. The streets are completely car free. This is an experimental new district that is seeing if excluding cars can life become better not only physically but also mentally. Many people driving on the roads daily tend to have more stress from overcrowding streets, noise, and most of all crashes. ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move to here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said heidrun Walter."" Source 1,3 From this evidence it shows that life without a car can actually have a better impact on a person.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is it reduces pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear smog from the global city after a near record pollution. From this ban almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and some even had their cars impounded due to their reactions from the fines. But these fines and bans came out with a positive effect in the end. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after a few days of putting the ban into effect. The smog cleared enough for the French ruling party to rescind the ban for certain days.

Has America's love for cars already started cooling? Or has technology taken the reason why we should drive away? Elisabeth Rosenthal states that , "" the interent makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. the renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" source 4, 35 I believe that since technology has evolved that people dont feel the need to leave home to meet friends when they can just use apps or call,text,facetime,etc.

These reasons I showed make me believe that limitng car usage can create positive advantages, I hope they make you feel the same way too."
9eef0839,0,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The majority of people that own a car have a lot of stress due to gas money and paying for the car. Owning a car is a serious expense. There are other types of transportation that can be useful for the people.

According to Source 1, in Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the people that live there do not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car in order to move there. People were starting to realize that when they owned a car they would always be tense. After getting rid of the car, they have been much happier and less stressed.

Since there are less cars in the streets of Germany, people have stopped and realized how beautiful everything was. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, is now relived as she walks the verdant streets where she can hear the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children.

In Paris, France due to the cold nights and warm days, the car emissions have been trapped by the warmer layer of air. Sometimes, weather can be the effect of something bad happening to your car. In the everyday world, people have been killed and have been in serious accidents. Not only because of the weather but also because of the lack of responsibility and concentration it takes to drive a vehicle.

As said in Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia many people do not drive cars. The majority of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work or wherever they need to go. The goal of this is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" while he was riding his bicycle along with his wife next to him.

As people ride bike or hike or even just walk around their city, they can see and learn many new things just by being more aware of their surroundings. Cars have been in this world for a long period of time already. It's time to take a break from the madness and start realizing how beautiful life is and how beautiful it can be by not destroying it with such a machine. Not only will there be less stress, but the world will be a lot more safer than it was."
bba147cf,1,"The Electoral College is how America votes for the President and Vise President, which is a process that the U.S. shouldn't have. initially, if people are voting for a President, they know what they want and have done their research. Along with that, it gives the electoral College more rights than the actually people voting for the President and Vise President. Lastly, it's just down right unfair to the voters. The U.S. wants every person to have equal chance at the election for a president and if about 500 people are voting compared to the millions, it's just unfair to the citizens. In the world now, this process is taking away the freedom of decision or making it seem useless to the people. The electoral College shouldn't be a process we use for voting.

Most people voting, actually care who is running the country and they took the effort to make sure they got the vote in. The votes from the actually people should count because, evidently, they know what they want. Most people do not go to a place if they do not care for the purpose, but if citizens are voting for their president, it should count, not having other elected officials vote. The elected officials voting, are in the government and that creates a biased vote which is uncalled for. The votes need to be from the people because they see the actual truths of what is happening to the economy, salary, taxes, the process of the government, and much more. It is obvious that having the people vote is a more efficient choice than preelected officials.

Secondly, the electoral college takes away the rights to choose what president they want. Yes, they get to vote for which electoral college member they want but, it doesn't actually add up to the number the citizens actually participate in. As stated in the Constitution, citizens of America have freedom, and they should have the freedom of choosing the Preseident and Vice President they want without out any ifs,ands, or buts. America has the freedom to choose and the electoral College shuts it all down, which is disrespect to citizens and to the country.

Lastly, it is such an unfair process. As said previously, it geneuinly takes our freedom of choice away. People need to be heard and listened for what they actually want but the government lives their own way and doesn't take into count what the people, that make the country up, want. ""Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the laidback defenses of the syster are wrong by Bradford Plumer. This here proves that the candidates are only in for the game and not the real true choice in who will be a perfect official that runs the country all together. Clearly, the process all together is a complete unfair, brutial game to the people.

In Retrospect, having the electoral College is a disaster and having it as a process makes we use every four years is unbelieveable. It treats the Americans like there freedom is worthless and makes the voting process unfair. If the people take the time to actually stand in line to vote, they hould earn the right of having their vote count in full picture. This process shouldn't continue on, for it is 500 or so people voting for the President and Vise President for over millions. That itself, is outragious and shouldn't be apart of the American voting process anymore."
70cd1937,1,"Dear Senator Nelson, In recent years, many people have called for the change of the presidential election process. Specifically, the Electoral College. Many consider it a pointless, unfair, and archaic system that denies the people the liberty of choosing their president. However, I believe the Electoral College is a necessity in modern America. Although it is as old as the country itself, it is still relevant and useful today.

The Electoral College ensures the outcome of an election. Without the Electoral College, the election may possibly need multiple reruns as a result of a tie in the popular vote. According to ""Does the Electoral College work?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"". With that few of electors, it reduces the chances of a tie occurring. Although it can happen however, it's not probable. For example, if two candidates ever had a tie among the popular vote, it could be resolved within the college because of the way the slates of electors are divided up among the states. Some critics of the college say that this systems takes the control out of the peoples hands and denies them the right of choice. However, you have to remember that the people elect a slate of electors to vote for their candidate. That means that even though the College ultimately decides the president, the people still have someone to represent their candidates.

The Electoral College is also a necessity because it forces the candidates to face issues the people care about and to appeal to the masses. According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluralarity in those states"". This means that in order to win the popular vote and get a chance to win within the Electoral College, a candidate must appeal to the country, not just a particular set of voters who may have different views on politics than the majority of voters. Some people say that a candidate may try to appeal to a set of voters but in the end just use them in order to win the presidency. To that I say this. As a candidate, your ultimate goal is to serve two full terms as the president of the world's leading superpower right? Why would a candidate want to lie and jeprodize their chances at doing what they feel is right for the country?

In Conclusion, the Electoral college must not be done away with. It is a necessary tool to maintain fairness among the candidates and the election process. We have checks and balances among the government so one branch of government may never gain more power over the others so why not supervise the most important process in government? If you take anything at all away from this letter, please let it be this. The Electoral College is a staple in American politics. Without it, we would be denying our country the right to a fair election."
ec84cc10,0,"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmosphere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town carfree. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completely true since plugin cars, hybrids, and other earthfriendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of fossil fuelpowered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come."
585624b3,0,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. It affects your mental health. It effects your environment. It effects people and companies economically, too. These articles provide a lot of information, and I'm going to use examples from the text to show you.

First, limiting car usage affects peoples mental health. Most people say it makes them happier using different modes of transportation.

""""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two,..."" This is an example from the 1st article, in German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elizabeth Rosenthal.

""""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" Here's another example, from carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota written by Andrew Selsky. Although some people are mad having to use a bus or a train with other people, it's a good stress reliever not having to drive all the time and not having to deal with the road rage.

Second, limiting car usage effects the environment. Cars give off gas that's not good for the Earth. The gas from the cars creates smog in some parts of the world.

""Paris typically has more smog than any other European capitals..."" In that quote from paris bans driving due to smog written by Robert Duffer, it shows that the smog is having an affect of them. Safety is also something that would be increased if we limited car usage.

""""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."""" With less cars around, people would be less likely to get hit. Right now, many people die every day from a car accident or a hit and run. If we lessen the amount of cars on the road, we'd also improve road rage and traffic flow.

Finally, limiting the amount of car usage would effect people and companies economically. People wouldn't have to pay for gas as much as they would have to. It would help out public transportation companies, like the company that runs the Lynx busses or the Line' in Chicago. It would cause a decline in autoinsurance companies and car companies that sell the cars.

""...companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle."" This quote from the article 'The End of Car Culture' by Elisabeth Rosenthal, shows that car companies are trying to stay ahead of their competition. They're trying to appeal to people who prefer bikes or buses rather than a personal vehicle.

""...recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" In this quote from the same passege, it shows that we're already nearing this goal. Car usage is already being limited by the newer generations of people who care about the planet and find it easier to bike or use public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting the usage of cars would help a lot. I think that helping the environment would really be good for us as people. Limiting the usage of cars would make it safer to walk around and bike outside, even drive. It helps people economically even though it hurts certain companies economically. It also helps us mentally by helping us be less stressful and calming down more easily. It would reduce road race as well as certain stress alltogether."
fe134dfe,0,"Since World War II we have been heavily dependent on the modern day transportation: the car. Some say the car is an innovative and convenient method of transportation, while others say that it will be the end of the environment. As the evidence indicates, there are advantages to limiting car usage.

Dissenters of the idea claim to say that limiting car usage will negatively impact the car industry, but it doesn't. Limiting car usage doesn't mean that people will have to stop buying cars it simply means that they will have to find a different method of transportation. Source 2 says that in Paris on certain days motorist, who had an odd or even license plate number, had to leave their cars at home and find an alternative method of transportation. Does the evidence demonstrate an impact to car companies? Did they have a financial deficit due to their lack of buyers? The answer is simple: no, because they didn't ban the use of cars. Also, car companies can well benefit from places that limit car usage but allow hybrid cars this allows for an increase in revenue. Most car companies in today's society model hybrid cars that run on primarily electricity and gas. In Paris, they made exceptions ""for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers Source 2"". These exceptions actually promote the buying of hybrid cars! This will boost the economic profit of the car companies, not damage it. Limiting car usage does not affect car companies, but instead supports it.

The limitation of car usage betters the environment. Cars emit greenhouse gases in the atmosphere faster than they can be removed. This causes health problems in living organisms and pollution of ecosystems. Cars are liable for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in areas in the U.S. as Source 1 states. People are playing with the balance of nature and if its not fixed then humans are as good as dead this is why the implementation of limiting car usage benefits people. The effects of this can be seen in Bogota, Colombia, whose goal is to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation Source 3, and Paris, where intense smog covered the enitre city: ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.Source 2"" The source explains that cold nights and warm days trapped in car emissions and after a few days of reducing car usage the air cleared up. This shows the effectiveness of the limiations of car usage.

The limiting of cars also boosts community wellness. The people who experienced this regulation had positive views on the matter and even on rainy days they participated! Bogota, Colombia has gone into its third year of banning cars and the turnouts of the pariticipation were large, with two other Colombian cities joining and municipal authorities from other countries to view the event Source 3. The evidence show that limiting cars wasn't opposed by the people, in fact, other countries were wanting to get in on the action. This limiting of car usage really cuts down on traffic congestion and new community projects have been established to ease the transition to alternative transportation. Heidrun Walter, mentioned in Source 1, syas that when she had her car she always tense and stressed and is happy with the change. The source also mentions that the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor Source 1."" This shows that the limitation of car usage greatly enchances the wellness of the community and promotes a safe and stressfree environment for the people.

In summation, the limitation of car usage doesn't negatively impact car companies, but instead increases hybrid car sale revenue, echances community wellness, betters the environment. The things that can be accomplished with this regulation only has benefits for everyone."
317d0afc,1,"Dear State Senator, I have realized that there has been debate lately about if we should abolish the Electoral College or not. Reading about this, you could swing either way and have a valid point, but I think my way has more valid points and makes more sense as a whole picture. The key here is the bigger picture because if you look at a small flaw of something for long enough it eventually takes up the whole picture in your mind. You may have your opions about it and I have mine but I would like to share mine with you so you can see why the Electoral College is still important and should still be used.

When our founding fathers sat down and decided to right up our federal government system, they argued emensly on voting and how it should go about. when they finished bickering and developed this system, they made sure everything had a checks and balances type of layout. With the Electoral College, "" you vote for the electors and they vote for president and vice president, and then congress counts the electorsial votes"". This idea is more beneficial then just having a majority vote for obvious reasons. With the electorsal votes and populous votes it makes it harder to choose a president just by a single vote advantage.

Now I know your probably yelling at this letter saying the disaster factor is the main problem with the electorsial college but let me finish. there have only been two times that this has happened. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then bush yet fewer electorsal votes, but that was the first time since 1888"". If this has only happened twice then I think it is something that is fixable, but should not be the deciding factor that takes away the whole Electoral College system. The main reason we have this system is so there is a certainty of outcome and not just one score that is judged.

The way this is set up is so that ""no region has enough electorsal votes to elect a president"". This is a great thing because imagine if it was just majority vote the most populated states could just vote who they wanted to be president and it would be done. No other states would be able to compete and on top of that the candidates for president would only have to campaign in the populated states where they know they are already liked. The Electoral College is there so things aren't done in a jiffy. With this system the candidates actually have to work on trying to gain supporters in states where they may not be liked in. It also makes the American people think about all the options and decide on a bigger scale that requires more then just ""one vote"" to win an election.

Can you see why we need this Electoral College to stay and not just be abolished over like it is some plastic bottle on the highway that gets avoided and never gets picked up. We need people to stay actively involved in voting and I personally think the Electoral College does the best job with this. If the founding fathers spent months upon months just argueing about this single topic, I do not think they would just blow it off last second and come up with some giberish. If this system has worked this well this long then I think they must of done something right. Please consider my opinion state senator. ""Voters in presidental elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election""."
134e57ff,1,"Dear Senator, The debate regarding the necessity of the Electoral College and it's validity has aroused some tension among the citizens of America, and the government as well. This process is not only used to decide the President of our nation, but to ensure the equality of the voting. By establishing our county as a democracy, we made a promise to maintain a systematic balance between the government and it's people. Without the existence of the Electoral College, where would this balance be? The Electoral College is the basis upon which our country is built, and is vital to uphold the balance and equality between government and people.

The Electoral College has many benefits towards the nation that many people are unaware of. For example, in order to do well, a candidate must have connections nationwide. In source 3, line 19, it states ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" This means that no candidate is guaranteed a win if they only appeal to one area or region. This creates an overall balance throughout the nation, and makes sure only a portion of the country doesn't have all the power. Also, this allows the people to have a clear understanding of who they're voting for, and what this means.

Equality is key, and without this equality, where would our nation be? By continuing the use of the Electoral College, we have decided to be the best we can be. It says in Source 1, line 1 ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" This provides valid information to support the necessary balance of people and government.

The Electoral College also produces a winner arguably qualified due to the amount of votes received. This is clearly described in Source 3, line 22, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" Due to the use of this process, the election of a President can be efficient and simple. The President can now be Some may argue that this process does not clearly represent the people or their votes. This is because some may vote for a ""slate of electors"" as opposed to the president. However, this belief can be decidedly rejected due to the lack of valid evidence to support the claim. How are voters expected to vote fairly if they are not given the support to do so?

Overall, it can be declared that the Electoral College plays a vital role in maintaining the internal balance of our nation that the citizens inhabiting it are so reliant on. Choosing to reject this process would be deciding to injure our nation, its future, and its people."
1992c36b,1,"Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any runoff elections. Runoff elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The reasonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all."
f3242ac2,0,"In cities such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, people are getting serious about cutting down on the vast usage of cars. The ""car free"" trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of pollutants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, ""The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental protection Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By eliminating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.

With less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunities for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reporters Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant moter"", and ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.

An official from Transportation for America says, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.

With many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear. By cutting down on our usage of cars, we help the enviromnent, promote health, and focus innovations elsewhere."
8fc3393d,0,"Go outside and take a deep breath, as it is right now you may feel refreshed and may even feel twinge of joy as you just took in a breath of the wonderful natural and clean air. But, as it so happens with the increase of greenhouse gases in the world, in just a few years this may not be the same situation. Instead of enjoying your breath, you may be coughing or choking on the polluted air. In the past few decades, our air pollution has gone up drastically and most of that comes from our cars. According to Source 1, written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars in Europe make up 12 percent of its greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in areas in the United States! That's a whole lot! Rest assured though, there is an easy and crucial way we can begin to cut down those numbers we must begin to limit our car usage.

Already, you may question this and begin to wonder if it is even a possible or logical request. Well, it is in many places throughout the world, communities have begun to forget about their cars and use bikes, walking, and more public transportation options instead of their cars. It can happen, in In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she informs us about an upscale community in Vauban, Germany where its residents have given up their reliance on cars. It's streets have no cars, except for the tram that runs to its downtown areas. While everyone is still allowed to own a car, and some do, they must park it at one of the only two areas to park in large garages where an owner must buy a space for up to 40,000! You may think that it's crazy but in reality it is not. The structure of the city allows almost everything to be in close proximity to one another reducing the need for a car. Many citizens have reported to be feeling better and happier as they feel more carefree and have the stress that cars bring removed from their lives. This helps to reduce the emission produced by cars and Vauban is one of the most successful cities and have been an influence in many areas.

Now, if you are not up to the idea of completely giving up your car then, there are several alternatives that you can do to help and will still reduce and limit your car usage. In Source 3, by Andrew Selsky, Mr. Selsky brings to us a fairly new tradition that started about 3 years ago in Bogota, Colombia. Bogota is Colombia's capital and one of the most populated cities. Bogota has a citywide day called, ""Day Without Cars."" It is simple enough, buses and taxis are only permitted while cars are banned. Millions of people walked, biked, skated, or found other ways of getting to work and frankly enjoyed it. Other citizens reported it as a fun day to take away stress while helping our endangered enviroment. This day that started only 3 days ago has now spread to other areas such as Cali and Valledupar, and Asuncion, Paraguay. Not only do these days help the enviroment but it also helps the citizens. All throughout Bogota, new parks and sports centers have been built, old and cracked sidewalks have been replaced with smooth ones, and new areas for income such as restaurants and upscale shopes have popped up around the city as well. The reason for the building and new employment of jobs is so that people will have reasons to walk around and allow for it to be more convient for others who work near by the areas. We also notice a similar idea arise in the lovely city of Paris, France. For those who don't know while Paris is known for it's impressive architecture and beautiful sights, it also has a bad reputation of being very polluted. This pollution comes from the amount of tourists it recieves as well as the different and populous amounts of motor transportation. In Source 2 by Robert Duffer, we see he examines several days in which the city of Paris bans driving due to the record amounts of pollution in the air. For those who were driving when they weren't supposed to be were fined and a few even had their car impounded for their reactions to the fine. Unfortunately, the government established in Paris realized that they had to do this after 5 full days of intensifying smog. At first, many were scared, confused, and even upset as to why this was happening but they began to see that it was neccessary. Once their levels of smog began to normalize, congestion is Paris was down about 60 percent! All in all, we need to begin limiting our usage of cars, from the examples provided it shows that in the end, it isn't such a bad thing after all. It increases, activities to do, work opportunities for people, and reduces air pollution. While, they were able to save Paris this time, next time they may not be so lucky. In the United States, according to Source 4 which is very reliable, we actually see a decrease in car usage overall. These rates have dropped for several reasons, and have about the same results and benefits. People have begun getting healthier, emission rates have decreased.

While the idea of limiting car usage may scare some people, it is proved to be extremely helpful. Limiting car usage helps reduce emissions, and increases job opportunities and everything."
86209d86,0,"In Vauban, Germany, citizens have made the decision to not use cars. To some people, this may be something that they could never imagine themselves doing, because it would make life more complicated. However, these people are pleased with their decision and would not have it any other way. Furthermore, there are many advantages to making this change. By limiting car usage, citizens can improve their own health and economic state.

By making the decision to stop using cars, one can become healthier, both mentally and physically. One citizen who has already taken this step said,""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal 3. Many people who chose to limit their car usage, decided to walk or ride bikes instead. By chosing the alternative, they are less stressed. There is something soothing about walking down the road in a quiet and peaceful environment. Walking gives one time to reflect and think, while driving requires concentration and can be stressful. In addition to improving one's mental health, limiting car usage can also improve one's physical health. Pollution from the air can take a toll on someone's physical health and the environment around them. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Rosenthal 5. Pollution poisons the air of most cities where people live and breathing the pollution is not healthy for an individual. In cities like Beijing, inhabitants wear air filters over their mouths in hopes fo escaping the pollution. Limiting car usage can help improve air quality quickly. For example, after having multiple days of intense smog, Paris decided to ban cars with evennumbered plates for one day. After this one day of limited car usage, ""the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday"" Duffer 19.

Another advantage to limiting cars is that it could mean economic improvement for individuals and countries. The banning of cars can mean improvement in the appearance of cities, which can have positive impacts on the economy of cities. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have beeen replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" Selsky 28. These improvements in the city can draw more people to them and stimulate the economy in places that have had difficulty before. In addition, individuals can save money by carpooling, biking, walking, or using public transit as an alternative optopn to driving. During the 2013 rececession, people were forced to sell their cars due to lack of money. However, after they recovered from this, they decided not to return to car usage due to their content in the lifestyle they had chosen Rosenthal 32 In conclusion, limiting one's usage of cars can have only positive impacts on one's life. This decision can have lasting impacts one's happiness, the environment, and the economy."
453b19ac,0,"""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously"". Car reduction helps the environment more than what people think it would. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United states greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in America behavior:recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". Not having a car is better for you and the environment because not only would you be exercising by walking but there will be less pollution in the economy. Cars waste to much gas and have a lot of unnecessary waste in them that could end up to be one day global warming and kill of all the good air we breath in now. People should look in to not having a car and start walking, biking, skating and do more than what they use to do when they had a car.

Paris, Germany, United States, New York, Colombia and many other places are starting be more car free because they heard what cars can do to the environment. According the text "" in Colombia has a program that they started that spreads to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day the other day, leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The more and more people hear about this program the more people will get into the habit of not having a car or not using a car to go everywhere they have to go to. ""If the patterns persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"".

Most people who are involved in the program see a huge difference in their community like the streets are cleaner, there are no traffic jams, the streets are safer, and there's less pollution in the air. As we all know that cars are sometimes important to us to get to where we need to get but is it really that important to us to have a car not really because if we would stop being lazy and just get up from our couches and walk, bike, or skate to where we needed to go we'll see that having a car is not as important as we used to think. In Colombia two other citizens joined the event and found that ""these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing broders"". So really one program can change the whole world if people just joined and saw for them selves what a huge impact it can be on others.

More parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city and there are more smooth sidewalks and restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift"". New York also started there own program which is this bikingsharing program and it's skyrocketed bridge and the tunnel tools reflect those new priorities, and of course a proiferation of carsharing program across the nation. In some cities you have to take a car like in San Francisco because everything is so far away and you can not walk to where you need to go it will take forever to get there walking which is understandable. But in other cities or places were everything is close to you then there's no point of taking a car instead of walking to the place you need to go to. Cars waste a lot of gas which means that gas prices go up way to much because of the usahe of cars instead of biking, skating, or walking. You get more done when your walking, biking, or skating because you are less worried about running out of gas or having to push the car to the nearest gas station."
7fd66b21,0,"Cars are a huge advantage in traveling. They can get people to places faster than a single horse could and their a lot safer than riding on a horse. While there are positive advantages to these moble transportation, there are also negative portions that cars have. You may be awfully surprised what these transports can do outside their good nature. For instance, cars run on fossil fuel, which is a artificial gas that ruins the environment as much as people cutting down trees and smoke coming out of nuclear plants that do damage to the clouds in the sky. Cars don't just hurt the environment, they hurt innocent lives as well. Let me pull out an example: Person A and Person C are driving on the interstate when Person B spills out too much fossil fuel from the exhaust pipe of his car. This causes both Person A & C to spin out of control and crash into each other because they couldn't see the road very well because of Person B. This isn't the only threat cars can pull into, but I'll get to that later. With all these bad occurrences that happen people have been wondering, ""how can we save both lives and the environment from the issues of cars at the same time""? There is a way to do just that: limiting car usage.

Like I said before, cars can have a lot of negative issues in their state of mind. Some examples are foggy weather, over usage of fossil fuel, speeding, texting and driving, drunk driving and many more that exist that I cannot mention. Because of these issues, cities like Vauban Germany, Paris France and Bogota Colombia have bannedwell not really banned but you get what i mean driving cars due to the bad issues cars canhave caused. In the US, the presentage of people driving cars has decreased a lot over the past few years the story doesn't say what persentage. As much as I hate them doing that, they actually have a reason. In this case of fellow citizens, car usage should be banned for various reasons. I won't be telling all the reasons because that would take a long time to do so.

Reason 1: Drunk driving. Have you ever known someone or heard about an incident were a person is drunk inside a car and crashes into any random source they don't see coming? Well, let us face the facts: drunk people should not drive. If someone is drunk at a bar and is feeling funny, they should either walk home or get someone to pick them up. Drunk people who drive have a great chance at getting someone hurt of themselves hurt because of their stupid attitude. The person shouldn't drive again until they are fully consious again. Reason 2: Extreme weather. When people drive in extreme, they are risking their lives in a greater persentage than a zombie apocolypse, terrorists invading any country and being attacked by people who try to kill you. Extreme weather like thunderstorms, hail and strong fog are too dangerous for people to drive in. If you drive in that type of weather, there is a 90% chance you will not make it out without injuries. People need to wait for the weather to either calm down or stop completelyI just wait until it stops completely so that it wouldn't get worse as it calms down. This will help them prevent them or anyone from getting a wreck. If it occurs randomly while your driving then your screwed. Reason 3: texting and driving. Why is it that most people in this generation keep getting stupid and stupid every single minute? This is one of those incidents that has such that. People who text while driving pay more attention to their stupid phone than focusing on driving. Like drunk driving people who care about texting so much need to either sit in the back and text or not ride in the car at all. They propably should stay away from a car as long as possible until they learn to not text and drive at the same time. You can't do two things at once unless you're some one fictional or a pro at it. Final reason: Expoit of fossil fuels. I don't need to talk much about this one because I already did in my first paragraph and it is related to the extreme weather topic but I will do it once more. Cars that exploit fossil fuels can cause damage to the environment. If the smoke is exploited too much it can not only more damage to the environment, but it can cause people to reck as well.

These are the reasons that fellow citizens like you should limit your car usages. Remember that cars are not a same transportation vehicle that can get you from point A to Point B, they have a dark side like everything else. Even if you do limit your car usages, it doesn't mean you are safe from the world that hunts you down. Be careful out there and follow the percautions of safty carefully when you are traveling either by car or anyother place."
fcd93e2d,1,"The electoral college is a group of electors that vote for the president and vicepresident. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" What Is The Electoral College, 1 They consist of 538 electors and you need a majority of 270 in order to be elected. They are wrong because they take the majority vote from the state's population and turn it into electoral votes which is a ""winnertakeall"" system, and they can be anyone not holding public office which can bring opinions into play, such as segregation.

The first and most important reason the electoral college is wrong is because they are based off of majority vote. This is bad because people who voted for the other party don't even get counted in the electoral votes. For instance, if there is a population of 1,000,000 people in a state and 600,000 of the people vote for one party, the majority goes to that party, but what about the other 400,000 people that voted for their party. And don't forget the 2000 election between Gore and Bush. Al Gore had the popular vote, yet lost the presidency. How does this make any sense? This leads to my final reasoning of why the electoral college is wrong...

The electoral college is wrong because the electors can be anyone not holding public office. Anyone not in public office could be basically anyone, even you or me. This can cause problems such as opinion, racism, etc. They could want somebody to become president because of their skin color or their political party. For example, ""in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, 11 What if this happens again? We could have a president that nobody even elected for as president and our government could drastically change.

Even though the electoral college is wrong, there is one good thing about it. This is because the ""certainty of outcome"" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, 15. Which mean that usually the electoral votes and the popular votes usually coincide with each other, where both are for the same person. For instance, ""in 2012's election Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and 51.3 percent of the popular vote"" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, 15. So this mean that for both electoral and popular he had the majority of the votes.

All in all, I agree with ""Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO"" with ""abolishing the electoral college!"" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, 15. Especially with the ""winnertakeall"" point of it. I think that the population should choose the president off of their opinions instead of being forgotten if their not in the majority vote. Everyone's vote should count. This would be a lot more fair to everyone."
7578fb27,0,"The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coincided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning carsreducing them will benefit our ecosystems and environments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing Source 2. That CO2 rises into the air, the atmosphere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of carpooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3 and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael siva brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, ""Mine 19 and 21 speaking of her children have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the environment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the citytown. In Bogota, Columbia according to Source 3 new paths have been opening up, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,"" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the environment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and checkup like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice."
af02afd3,1,"Politics is everywhere and it rules our everyday lives. Each United States citizen has a role in choosing how our politics can operate. It might not be a huge role but it definitely is an important small role. The presidential election happens every four years on the first tuesday of November. There is an electoral college which is the compromise between election of president by vote in congress and by popular vote of citizens. As state senator, I think you should keep the electoral college running because it is a safer option than just doing election by popular vote.

The electoral college consists of professionals in congress that are more specialized in politics then an average citizen is. The electoral college should be handed the trust to control our politics. There must be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect that President. Each candidate running for president must have his or her own electoral group. The electors are chosen by the candidates political party, which means the person running for President if in good hands with his electoral college.

Al Gore lost the presidency, but he won the popular vote. Maybe the professionals in the electoral college saw a flaw in him that the average citizen would not see. 60% of people prefer doing the direct election popular vote. The direct election would only satisfy themselves temporarily, but what if this president that got elected put the whole country in a downfall. Then people would realize how important the electoral college is.

There are some cases where the election process ends up being a disaster. What if citizens weren't able to chose the electors and the state legislatures were fully in charge of choosing those electors. Well, the electors can still chose to go by what the people want. In 1960, the segregationist almost replaced Democratic electors with the new electors that opposed John F. Kennedy. Some electors have even went against their political party's candidate and only choose who they wanted to chose. The segregationist that were in power at that time only wanted what they thought was best for them and not what was best for the people. Situations like this must require the votes and thoughts of the average citizens combined with the electoral college.

The electoral college has voters voting for electors only and not the president. The electoral college should stick around forever. Popular votes might not always be the best option. The citizens still have a say in which electors shall be chosen and that plays a part in electing the president. Even though voters are not always able to control who the electors vote for, they still have a part in chosing who will be president."

fb2d565c,1,"Dear senator, Imagine it being the year for choosing for a new president for the United States of America. You cast your vote, for which president you thought that would be best to run our country. After, you hear the results you become very disappointed , Because the president won not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. You become very angry and frustrated because the president that will now be running for America will not better our country by the things he said. Reasoning, that he won by the electoral college and not by popular vote, and you feel as if you dont feel as if it was not fair because you're not really choosing based on the state laws and how the electors are selected. How would you feel if you were in a situation like this ?

Furthermore, i think we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. My reasoning being said is because when the president wins by popular vote it's from what the american citizens want, not what the electors chose. When you choose by popular vote you also avoid many other things from occurring. For example, the electoral college is a method of selecting the president that may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. As explained in the text "" voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" Moreover, the electoral college is unfair to voters. candidates dont spend as time in states they know they have no chance of winning, and only focusing on the states that they do. As said in the text "" In a 2000 campaign , seventeen states dont see the candidates at all, including in rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. Making that hard for the people to see what there president wants to do for the country they have no idea because of the candidate too worried on winning and letting the citizens choose.

To elaborat on my claim, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The disaster factor is what happened in the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century , which allows the system for much worse. In the electoral college state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and those electors would effect the will of the citizens. sometimes ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever thet please."" Making another reason why the electoral college should'nt be here to stay.

Although, keeping the electoral college may not be a good thing to do."
1a6f8b76,0,"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years. More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline. In Robert buffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with. In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars. The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage. In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""Duffer 16 This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel. Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket. Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment. In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.SRosenthal 5. This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars. By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs. A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.Rosenthal 37"" A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that. The encouragement of governments to suggest carpooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls. If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road. Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.Rosenthal 40 Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once. With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year. Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.Selsky 20By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars. With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road. Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored. Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.Rosenthal 35 Because of this, people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family. This has created a domino effect people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society. They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues. By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment."
eafb8a56,0,"Limiting car use causes pollution, increases costs to users regardless of where services or services are offered. Furthermore, over use of the gas results in increased environmental degradation, harming our resources while damaging our environment.

When consumers pay a larger amount before gasoline is refined then there are higher costs of running the engine than otherwise. There are fewer places where the gas can be purchased locally causing more problems. Car trips will usually have higher tolls which results in lost wages for the transportation worker, who goes to an unnecessary location for work and then returns home and gets to pay back his transportation back costs. The car accident rate amongst children also has increased. Car pollution can become airborne easily, contaminating children's health. Also children tend to be more careless and more often in accidents simply because of being pushed out of their cars onto the road. All of this can be done to better an already polluted Earth that is becoming increasingly damaged at a much faster rate. Limiting our vehicle use helps our citizens with a reduced budget. It also reduces pollution for local areas. Furthermore, it improves public health and makes city dwellers a wealthier society.

Limiting our own usage by adopting public transportation, walking, biking, and public transport actually would be beneficial for the citizens and planet. I think its very healthy but very little others show similar sentiment mostly environmental activists who want a more environmentally clean place so it often is still looked down upon it still will bring about a very drastic price eventually but there will never be carbon credit trading or an oil recycling scheme unless people want it too. Limiting car use is good for the city."
6e163f76,1,"As you may know, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors, which is a even number. As said in ""The defenseof the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing President,"" that even number can be a result of a tie in electoral votes, but is highly unlikely. But even then it is unfair to those who ""like"" the system, where as I oppose the voting system. Like everyone, I have my reasons1 electoral college is a disaster factor' 2 Voters don't vote for the President, but the electors instead.

To begin with my first reason, that electoral college is disaster factor as said in ' The indefensible of the electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong' the system had a fiasco, as you may call it, back in the 2000 election was the biggest crisis in a century. Also in 1960, segregationist in Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing Democratic Electors which electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so that the popular vote wouldn't have gone to Kennedy. What else has hepened in the 1960s? As you may or may not know, Vice President Richard Nixon, validated only his opponent's electors. With this, the Electoral College has flaws or loopholes making it a disaster factor.

As for my second reason, that the electoral collge is unfair to voters. Electors may not always be faithful to their party, as said in ' The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong' electors could vote for another candidate if they refused to vote for their party's candidate. Meaning that if a voter votes for a certain elector to vote for a certain President, then their votes probably wouldn't count. Also, because of the winnertakesall system, candidates do not spend time in states that the are aware that they have no chance of winning them over, but focusing on the 'swing' states. For example, in the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see candidates at all and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. Candidates shouldn't just avoid states that they have no chance in, but take that chance.

Even though the Electoral College is unfair and a disaster factor, it also fair in the state department. Smaller states votes area as equal as a bigger states votes, and the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have a transreagional appeal which makes sure that a candidate doesn't just go to a ragion that he knows he will get votes from, but to others that will allow him to gain more voters.

So in conclusion to my knowledge, the Electoral College voting system should be changed for so that the system wouldn't be disfuntional and unfair to voters. Which will make electing a president functional and fair to voters."
6256a3e5,0,"As time progresses, more and more young people aren't buying personal cars but instead use public transport or walk to where they need to go. Other than the youth, suburbs have found this as a great way to distress as some cities, like Bogota, Columbia, have dedicated a day to stop the use of personal cars for one day. This decline of using our own cars has a positive effect on our air and the way our youth has begun to travel.

People around the world are starting to make this transition from using their personal cars to using public transport or carpooling with friends. The youth today try to mange their schedules so they can find ways to use more and more of public transit. ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 and 39 yearolds getting a license..."" Rosenthal 38, meaning that most of the youth these days are finding it easier and, though a little more time consuming, less worrisome than buying or driving a personal car. It seems getting a license isn't taking top priority for the youth. ""In a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..."" Rosenthal 41.Whether the youth is going to start buying cars when they have children or not, it seems the general decline of buying automobiles for yourself isn't a boom like it used to be.

Experiments being hosted all over the world in small areas also show that using no cars is decreasing pollution and allowing us cleaner air overall. In Bogota, Columbia, a program that bans all cars for one day, and despite terrible weather for the third year, and it seems that people are loving it. And despite the threatening rain, the turn out was huge Selsky 22. ""...experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe...""Rosenthal 5. Our personal cars ""are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States where areas are heavily populated with car owners""Rosenthal 5. Numbers like this would decline over time if we start using less and less cars. Maybe then we'd actually have fresh air to breath rather than the polluted air we breath now. Even in Paris, where they have ""enough smog to compete with Beijing""Duffer 14 they banned cars for a while. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paries enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""Duffer 10. As they enforced the ban, smog started to clear up around the city, meaning that no cars can really help clear up the air we breath in daily.

As the air begins to clear up and our youth taking a stand against owning their own cars, it seems like this could be a steady decline of personal cars and more will start using public transport. It seems time is progressing to an age where young people don't feel the haste of using personal cars and instead resort to public transport."
b25c98bc,0,"In our society today, limiting car usage would be the best way to go. There are plenty of advantages to limiting car usage, with a decrease in pollution just to name one of them. If we can capitalize on the downward shift of automobile users in the United States and around the world, then it would benefit all of us in more ways then one.

Having a car can be handy to get from point A to point B, but what if you just do not need to use that car at all? What if you are just to lazy to walk or bike to your destination? I am not saying you should walk 80 miles to your aunt's house, but what if it was just to the store that was a half of a mile away. Not to mention that you would be saving good on gas money. There is a mostly car free suburb, for example, in Germany that focuses on a majority of the population of the neighborhood to not use cars. This town is named Vauban, and 70 percent of families do not own a car here. It may sound bad to those who live and die by their car, but with everything in walking distance it makes it easy and accessible to walk from point A to point B most of the time. The residents of this suburb are positive about this change, and they should be, because it is a positive change.

One very large problem with the excessive use of cars in one area is air pollution. Lots of cars in the same area commuting can create a thick layer of smoke in the air called smog, and it is not pleasant to experience on the road. That being said, Paris had recently gotten so much smog in the air that it had to put down a partial ban, license plates with even numbers could not drive on Monday, while odd numbered plates could not drive on Tuesday. It sounds crazy, how could such a busy city like Paris realistically put down a travel ban on half of the commuters? Whether you thought it would or not, it worked. Sure there were a couple of motorists who could not take no for an answer and still commuted when they were not suppose to, but a large majority followed the rules of this ban. Apparently the French government underestimated the factor these cars had on the environment, as the ban was recinded early on Tuesday for the pollution almost completely cleared away.

In support of those two points, the amount of drivers every year has been going down since its peak point in 2005. The gap is nearly nine percent, almost a tenth of the United States has stopped driving in the last 10 years. With this pattern taking place, scientists believe that it will only have postive benefits for the environment and the communities in the forseeable future. The United States is one of the most polluted countries in the world, which in large part is because of our advanced and highly populated culture. That doesnt mean we cant make a difference and help our community grow into a better place environmentally. One good example of that happening is the car free day in Bogota. In this city millions of people got around without using cars and have been since 1995 in this program. It has led to the blooming of brand new parks and repaved, smoother sidewalks. If millions of Colombians can make their community a better place in a heavily populated area, so should we.

To summarize, plenty of places around the world are making good efforts to tone down on car usage. This helps bring down levels of air pollution, enhance the community that those people live in and help their financial situations by saving money on buying a car. If we in America can make these kind of efforts to decrease car usage, our whole country would be better for it in more ways than one."
f2bb2a2c,1,"Dear State Senator, I am here to inform you that you should change election to a popular vote for the president of the United States. This is due to the fact that as of now Americans vote to elect their president, but what good is that if they don't even receive what they want? What is even the point of voting? Saying this, I agree with source two on its point, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This is backed up with data from the same article stating that voters can't even control whom their electors vote for. This is clearly why ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Without a doubt if you cared for your people, the people who support you and give you your job opportunity, you would see that you should abolish this electoral college. Even a blind man could see that.

You may be wondering if your people think this is such a bad idea, why would our founding fathers implement something so horindess? As you see ""electoral college was established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"", says source 1. Although that sounded great at the time, today electoral college is frowned upon because majorly because of its ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. As if that wasn't unfair enough, the electors don't even necessarily have to vote for their states choice. This would be similar to if I was infatuated with a color, I then asked my team what our team color should be and after taking a vote, I chose the color I preferred because I was bias even though my whole team disliked it. This is obviously the wrong way to run our election especially the most important in our country.

On the other hand I do understand that there are some advantages to an electoral college. These include, mentioned in source 3, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaignthan a small state does. This is fair because there are more people in big states then small therefore big states should get more of a voice. Although in popular vote big states would still get the bigger vote because there are more people voting therefore they have more votes. This is why I think the middle man should just be cut out leaving us with a popular vote.

According to the facts it is clear to me that the electoral college should be siezed. I think it is unnecessary as well as unfair. When we think of voting for our president, that is what we want to do. Voting for our president does not include voting for someone who may or may not choose our choice. Also if we chose our President by popular vote all the votes that weren't majority would add up and possibly make the difference between the vote results. This is why it is unfair to simply use majority rule for each state and practically erase the other votes off the table. As you can see State Senator your people vote to elect their ruler. Why deny them of this oppurtunity. It is clear to me that the electoral college may have been a good concept to our founding father but when applyed is not the best decision. This is why I think you should change to an election by popular vote for president of the United States."
17fd4b1d,1,"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced delegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definite winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winnertakeall"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the candidates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swinglike tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more."
dae50a19,1,"Dear state senator, The electoral college is an unfair and irrational, and should be abolished immediately. The fact that the race for president can end in a tie is completely absurd. Also the fact that popular vote can mean basically nothing is dumbfoundidng. In a country of democracy popular vote seems like a it would be standard. popular vote seems like the best idea when it comes to a country for the people.

The electoral college is highly unfair to voters. Presidential candidates dont even have to visit all of the states to win the elections. The representation that the smaller states get is unfair. Presidential candidates will only visit states with a high number electoral college representatives because the states are known as ""swing states"". Swing states greatly influence the outcome of the election because they can hold the most power. If a state such as texas with 34 electoral votes was to have the same amount of power as a state with a much smaller population than the electoral college would seem much more viable.

The electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with that states popular vote. Al Gore, in the 2000 presidential election, won the popular vote but still lost the electionPlumer 9. The fact that a candidate can win the vote of the people but still lose the election is horrifying. How can you trust a system that works against what the United States of America is about. It completely takes away the right of people to decide what goes on in there government. The fact that the electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with people is highly unfair.

There is one crucial flaw in the electoral college, the election can end in a tie. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if just 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other wayPlumer 12. If we were to switch to a system were all states including the District of Columbia get one vote then the election could never end in a tie. Although this still seems highly unfair to the voters because the representative could go either with or against the popular vote the election could still never end in a tie solving the amjor flaw. What was to happen if we did have a tie? It has not yet been desided because it never has happened and that is a major problem.

The electoral college is highly unfair and should be disposed of immediately. The electoral college is biased towards the larger states,has major flaws that can only be fixed by getting rid of the system and does not give a fair view of what the people want. The system was poorly thought out and needs to be replaced.

sincerely, Jordan P."
937522be,0,"Do you want to live in a place where the air is polluted? Somewhere it is hard to breath. The earth would be a cleaner and more efficient place to live if we limit the everyday usage of cars. Just think about it by limiting the usage of cars you are saving money and making the earth a cleaner place. It's like the old saying goes ""kill two birds with one stone.

Who doesn like having some extra money in there pockets to spend? I know I definetely do. By limiting the usage of cars people will no longer have to pay a car payment. Or even better have to pay these outrageous gas prices. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have at law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" If we limit the usage of cars there wont be any reason to build new highways and the money can go to more important things.

Wouldnt you like to wake up in the morning, walk out side and get a wiff of fresh clean air? Limiting car usage will also cut the amount of green house gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emotions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states."" Cars are major contribution to the pollution we have in the air today. Having cleaner air makes the earth an all around better place. The people will be happier and the grass will be greener. ""Last week paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london."" I dont know of any person on this earth that wants to breath in particulate matter on a daily basis. ""Its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said business man Carlos Arturo. This man is in his right mind. Polution is a major stressor for everyone. Thats why I say by limiting car usage it will make people happier. People act like riding a bike is a bad thing. Its always good to get some exercise and be healthy.

If we aren't using cars thers no reason to have highways. And if we dont have highways then city will be smaller.""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in mall along some distant highway."" Where i grew up everything was close. There were resturants less than a mile away. The mall was a 5minute bike ride. And school was only 10 minutes away. Everythig was convienent. I didnt have to get in the car and hope that it started it up. There was no waiting in traffic. All I had to do was hop on my bike and ride off.

If we stay at the rate we are going now the earth is going to turn in to a place that no one wants to live. So if we limit the usage of cars the earth will be a overall better place to live. If we dont drive there is less polution. If we dont have cars we dont need highways and the our city will be more compact. And no cars means more money in our pockets. If that doesn sound like a perfect place to live then I dont want to know what your idea of perfect is."
7475d6a7,1,"The electoral college is not a good thing and it certainly messes things up it takes votes away from people, It changes the votes to make a person lose presidency even by changing the senators, and it's a winner take all system these dont turn out good no matter what. It's even overthrowing the people with the popular vote yes it sadly is possible.

Why would you still have the electoral college if it doesnt help anyone at all?

There are many many ways to win an election and this is not one good way it can easily make one side lose even if they won the popular vote. The odds of one side winning is easily changed with electoral votes. This interrupts the odds of how much the people likes them then it turns into how much the government of states likes them. However it could help some people win if they are not the popular vote.

It can also make anyone with the popular vote lose when they should have won like after Al Gore during the gallop poll thanks to the perks of the electoral college won the popular vote but he lost presidency over it. Even though 60% of people prefer the direct election now some prefer the electoral college.

But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it. A good argument was when the system allowed for far worse when the electors for defy the will of people like in passage 2 it says ""in 1960 when segragationists in the louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing electors who would oppose John F. kennedy"" that is just evil. Although the law has not been changed since the Constitution was made.

Even at the most basic level the electoral college is still unfair to voters because of the winner take all system put in place for each state. They saddly dont visit every state in passage 2 it says ""Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have 0 chance of winning, focusing only on tight races"" Although the winner take all is made just to do what they are using it for by awarding electors to the presidential candidate exept for Maine and Nebraska it is being used for what they are using it for.

In all the electoral system is not good but its not all bad it takes the votes away from the people,Its a winner take all system, and its taking people down who deserve to win even changing the senators to make them win. Its evil and makes no sense to what they are doing trying to give other parties a chance i get it but its gone a little to far."
21f409bc,1,"The electoral college should be abolished because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector source 1, and the voters cant always control who their electors vote for source 2. On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote source 3.

When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector source 1. Most people, including me, would like to vote for the president not a candidate because they might not even vote for the person you want for president. Some states are smaller then others so that makes them feel like their votes arent as important as the bigger states like California and Texas. The electoral college consists of only 538 electors compared to how many people are actually in the U.S. so there is a greater chance that the wrong president might be elected.

Many people do not vote because the voters cant always control who their electors vote for source 2. Not everyone wants to take the chance of voting for the wrong person to be elected for president. Some voters might get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate, as it says in source 2. Most states are small so most people in those states dont think the little states matter and they arent important in the election when they actually do.

On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote source 3. A better thing about the electoral college is that it requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, meaning that not all the vote can come from one or two regions and no other ones. Voters in presidential elections are the people who want to express a political preference rather than the people woh tihnk a single vote can dicide an election.

As a student I want the best for the up coming generations, including me, that are going to be able to be a part of the presidential elections and to not be confused who to vote for or how the electoral college works. Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person."
55ba6cf0,0,"The idea of a carfree life has become more appealing around the world. In the United States, South America and across Europe, they have developed new ways of transportation that seem to be more beneficial. In these sources they explain the many advantages of limiting car usage such as its better for the environment and people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and cheaper.

There are many benefits to limiting car usage and the first is it improves the environment. In Source 1, it says that reducing car usage would be, ""A huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe"". Passengers in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and 50 percent in the United States. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. In that change recently,there has been many efforts to promote ""car reduced"" communities. In Source 2, Paris shows that they have made improvements in banning driving on certain days of the week due to smog. That smog cleared enough for the people to drive on days they were allowed to.

The second benefit to limiting car usage would be that people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and they are happier. ""When i had a car iwas always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Many people expressed that other ways of transportation like biking or walking are much easier. In Source 3, it explains that Colombia has carfree days where they skate, bike, hike, or take buses instead. ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.

In Source 4, it says that because of other ways of transportation are easier and cheaper, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year."" It goes on to explain that ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway."" As more people become jobless, they find that taking buses or walking is much easier. That could be an advantage because Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out a plan where cities in which ""pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" In conclusion, there are many ways in limiting car usage can be benefical such as with the enviroment, to the people, and it can change in the way this world operates. Living a carfree life would soon be very desirable in this world soon."
4e3b5fd4,1,"The Electoral College is a system of appointing electors. These electors vote upon who will be the next president. Citizensvoters believe that they should be the ones able to decide who will become the president. People claim that this system should be changed to the ""popular vote"" system. This system is based on the people's votes. Even the smallest of states get their say in who will take the presidency. This form of electing should be put into play. The Electoral College should be abolished. It is interfering with citizen's rights. It is irrational, and should be changed.

Untrustworthy is a word used to describe the Electoral College. It can not be trusted. In some cases, the college is said to have chosen a candidate based upon themselves, not their state. An example of this appears in the election of 2000. In this election, 17 states were said to have never even seen the candidates. Voters said that they didn't even see campaign ads. This could have been caused by the college. The Electoral College is unjust.

A new case appears on 1960. In this case, Louisiana tried to recieve new electors who would go against J.F.K. Their electors weren't going with their beliefs. This is just one example of the injustice. Voters everywhere feel the college is unfair. They would like to have a greater role in the outcome of elections. They wish to feel more a part of this country.

Others say that the Electoral College should stay. They believe in five reasons for the acceptance of the system. One reason is the ""certainty of outcome."" The second reason is ""everyone's president."" This is saying that the college needs a presidential candidate to have appeal. This means that candidates need to not only campaign in popular states. Doing this makes the other states feel discouraged and feel as if their votes are not important. The next reason is due to the swing states. This is saying that they need to focus their campaigning on small, ""tossup"" states. Next reasoning is due to big states. They say the college restores and manages political balance. The last reasoning is that the college avoids when no candidate gets a greater amount of votes. This is saying that the college is able to break any ties between candidates.

Despite the reasonings given by the opposing side, the college causes problems. It is limiting voters' freedoms and rights. The voters want to be a part. They want to help their country. They want to be there to partake in the election and to choose their president fairly. The college is unjust and confusing. With the college, you do not know if you are getting the candidate that your state had voted for. The accuracy of your vote could be questioned. For these reasons and more are why we should change the system. We should remove the Electoral College system and replace it with the ""popular vote"" system. With this change we are ensuring the accuarcy to our voters. They will be able to take full part in the electoral election process. They will be able know for sure who and where their votes are going to."
8ed5b866,1,"The Electoral College has been here for many years. Over the aast years many aeoale think it is unfair to the voters. There are many conflicts that have risen about it. Without a doubt , the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because they voters are basically voting for no reason. The aresident they want to vote for doesnt count and instead the votes of the Electoral College do , the electors shouldnt be the only aeoale to vote just because they are qualified doesnt mean only their oainion and choice should be heard. Also , a direct election would be much better and everyones votes count and its equal.

To begin with , when the first Electoral College was made no one really argued about it. But over the many years conflicts have come. Peoale have realized that was is being done istn fair or right. "" At the most basic level , the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because the winnertakeall system in each state , candidates dont saend time in states they know the have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" state"". source 2, a. 13. Everyone has the right to vote but if their votes dont count whats the aoint?. Peoale should have the right to voice their own oainion and be aart of the voting. The electors that are chosen have only a little amount of oainions. If the voters would be included there would be a variety of choices of who should win. Every american should be comfortable and certain about who they voted for and if the Electoral College votes contradicts that there can be aroblems.

Furthermore , In a direct election everyone is treated equally. Unlike , the voting we have now , ""If you lived in Texas , for instance , and wanted to vote for John Kerry , you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors aledged to Kerry"". source 2, a. 10. Voters cant always control whom their electors vote for but voters sometimes can get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Why have so much going on when you can aeacefully just count the votes of the voters and electors together?. Yes , they may be the electors and might have more knowledge of whats going on but they are just aeoale too and everyone is created equally so definitely their votes shouldnt be the only ones actually counted.

Moreover , Bigger states may have a bigger effect on the votes because of their large amount of aeoale voting. By , not making their vote count some aeoale can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting haaaens for a reason if gives the world a chance to aick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right aerson but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their aower and freedom to saeak. "" Voters in aresidential elections ae aeoale who want to exaress a aolitical arefeence rather than aeoale ho think that a single vote may decide an election"".source 3 , a.23. The Electoral College may have worked in the aast but now its not working as well.

To conclude , The Electoral College arocess should be stoaaed for numerous number of reasons. It limits aeoales oainions and aeoale are voting for no reason if they cant aick who they want. Whoever is running for aresident and everyone who votes for one aerson shouldnt just be heard from a certai groua of aeoale. Everyones oainion should matter."
c54eb14d,0,"Cars have been popular and widely used ever since they were invented. They offer a fast and efficient form of transportation across both long and short distances. In this aspect, cars may appear extremely beneficiary and useful in everyday life, but there are always downsides to great inventions, especially the invention of the car. More and more people from all around the world are realizing the harms that car usage brings and are beginning to abandon their cars altogether. The most apparent reason as to why cars are damaging is because of the great amount of greenhouses gases they emit into the atmosphere. They also bring about pollution and smog with them. Finally, and maybe surprisingly to some, people are actually happier without these pollution monsters.

To start, cars expel shocking amounts of greenhouses gases from their tailpipe. By limiting usage of these automobiles, the amount of green house gases can be significantly reduced. According to the source, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, cars produce up to 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in places like Europe, but an eyepopping 50 percent in the United States where there is heavy car usage. This is a lot of noxious gas that is being put into the atmosphere, and poses a serious harm to the people living in these cities. Greenhouse gases are an especially maleficent form of pollution because greenhouse gases tend to trap heat and other types of pollution from escaping the atmosphere, leaving filth in the air that are then absorbed by the lungs, ""choking cities Rosenthal 8."" This is without a doubt a serious problem, but it can be corrected simply by not driving as frequently. According to The End of Car Culture, ""But America's love affair with it vehicles seems to be cooling...If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants Rosenthal 3234."" Simply by reducing car usage, these harmful toxins can be removed from the atmosphere.

Pollution is another quite obvious reason to why restricting car usage is beneficial. Cars release other toxins and gases as well that contribute greatly to pollution and smog.

Paris bans driving due to smog tells the story of how driving had to be banned for days because of the worst pollution the city has ever seen. According to this passage, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 144 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found Duffer 1417."" This is a ton of particulate matter that will be all breathed in by the people there if they are not removed. Paris, Brussels, and London are not only the cities plagued by this pollution from cars as ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world Duffer 14."" Smog from pollution negatively effects many aspects of life, but the worst was that ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions Duffer 14."" This phenomenon forces the people to breathe these particles into their lungs. Pollution is a terrible occurence that tags along with car usage, but by simply banning cars with evennumbered licnese plates off the road for one day, the smog greatly lightened in severity, enough for the city of Paris to lift the ban. No one wants pollution in their city, and simply by cutting back on car usage, pollution can be greatly reduced for the benefit of the people.

Finally, and most surprisingly, people are actually happier and less stressed without these modern horses. Heidrum Walter, a mother who lives in the city of Vauban Germany, a community devoid of cars, says in the passage, Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , ""'When I had a car I was tense. I'm much happier this way Rosenthal 3.'"" Carlos Arturo Plaza, a man in Bogota, Colombia, also commented during Bogota's Day Without Cars, in the source, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution Selsky 24.'"" This may seen a little puzzling at first as to why people would not enjoy fast and convenient transportation, but then the answer becomes pretty obvious. Without cars, parks, sport centers, and other outdoor recreational places have started to pop up more amd more on the streets of cities once bustling with cars. The roads are much less congested and new shops and food centers have appeared as well. Limiting cars pleases people in many different aspects of their life.

Cars may appear to be helpful at times, but in reality, citizens are better off without these transportation machines. Not only do they greatly pollute the air and cause smog, they also spew out noxious greenhouse gases that cause more damage to the society as a whole. Finally, and probably most importantly, the citizens themselves enjoy life better when these cars are out of them. Although this doesn't mean cars should stop being manufactored altogether, people should think twice before jumping in their car next time."
9aeb2766,0,"It seems that almost everyone I know has a car. However, cars are the creators of a large number of problems. There are a number of reasons that less car usage would be beneficial to our society. This could include limiting pollution and congestion, improving health, as well as saving money.

Cars are responsible for a large part of greenhouse gas and carbon emissions. Cutting car usage would immensely help our environment, which is a goal that many people want to achieve. In some cities in the United States of America, cars are responsible for as much as 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Some cities, like Beijing, China are so polluted, that smog is abundant throughout much of the city, making walking and other outdoor physical activities very unpleasant. Limiting car usage would help narrow that pollution a lot. Our environment has been negatively affected for a long time due to car usage, so it is time for that to change.

While many people would say that cars are a necessary means of transportation, there are many other available sources to cut car usage. These sources could include walking, bicycling, skating, taking a bus, carpooling, as well as many other activities. Not only do some of those activities not pollute our environment, but they are also healthy exercises. Cars are also a large reason for accidents and injuries. A large number of people die or get injured every day due to car crashes. While many people are safe drivers, car accidents are almost unavoidable.

Limiting car usage is another way of saving money, which is something that just about everyone I know wants to do. You end up spending a lot of hard earned money on gas or insurance rates because of cars. I know that many of my teenage friends are always bugging their parents for gas money. By using other means of transportation, that money could be saved and spent on something worthwhile to you.

By now, you should see all the positive effects of limiting car usage. While cars are a large part of transportation, there are a number of available sources of transportation that can be used instead. I hope that next time you are planning on going somewhere, whether it be spending time with friends or going to work, you will think about another source of transportation besides a car."

966b2454,0,"Millions of people around the world use cars, trucks, or any means of transportation, although some cities have started to limit or even ban their car usage. This has both made people happy and others were angered. Even so limiting car usage is actually beneficial in many ways.

Limiting car usage is a beneficial idea because it benefits with the environment. Cars have been known for polluting the skies and the very air that we breathe. As a matter of fact ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars"" source 1. This means that if this magnitude of greenhouse gases are being emitted by passenger cars alone then the air will be polluted and animals plants and other organisms will die. Additional evidence supports the fact that car limitation is a beneficial act to society. According to Source 3 by Andrew Selsky, the people of Bogota Columbia have been satisfied with the limitations of car usage in the city, the article states that ""it's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution""source 3. This means that in the limiting the idea of car usage we can decrease the pollutants that poison may living things around the world.

Another advantage in limiting the amount of car usage is that it lowers traffic. Many of todays roads are conjested by thousands of people using the road for their own purposes in shrinking the level of cars being used we can shrink that by a large amount. This is supported by Source 2, written by Robert Duffer, in this article he explains that cars, trucks, etc. are the cause of much congestion and pollution. This contributes to why Paris decided to pass a partial driving ban in Paris. According to this source since the ban car congestion went down by 60 percent source 2. This means that the streets are now safer and clearer in the area. Other sources state that car bans in Bogota Columbia have lead the residents of that city to find other means of transportation to devoid traffic source 3. This means that if cars are limited then traffic will decrease.

A benefactor in limiting car usage isit eliminates stress. Car infested areas have meant tons of stress. By limiting the cause of the problem then you eliminate the problem itself. According to Source 1 people in the outskirts of Germany have become more relaxed in life since cars have been banned. ""I feel less tence"" one of the people the author interviewed said. This key evidence means that if cars are limited then people can live a relaxed worry free life.

Car limitations are a beefit to todays society in ways that it can progress human society rather than pull it back with all the problems it causes. Are cars really what society needs."
06ee2a22,0,"In the generation we are living in today cars are a huge part of our everyday lives. Whether it's going to schoolwork, hanging with friends or anywhere really people rely on their cars for everything and you never hear anyone talk about walking, biking and taking another way of transportation. It's whole new era with how are society is created and working but it's how we are living, and it seems to be working. Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky all have the same mindset when talking about cars while each are talking about a different reason to decrease car usage, they all have a common interest in wanting it to be implied or simply like how it is being enforced. So after reading very specific, factual, and information articles I now know the advantages of limiting car usage and that is to save time and businesses, conserve resources, and having a vast decrease in car culture.

Imagine yourself on a bad morning, you woke you late and you're probably rushing out the door for work, and as a fellow American I would know that there is early morning traffic no matter where you are headed. But if you didn't use a car and maybe walked or rode a bike you could easily get there faster if it was a reasonable distance. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets fo this capital city eerily to devoid of traffic jams"" Selsky, par 20. This goes to show that when people took other steps to get to work instead of cars that there was no traffic jams. Which means no waitng which also means getting to work at a normal time, or for some, even on time. When you think about it you know that the roads can be a really busy and hetic place to be if you time it just right, so if you take the extra measure and maybe walk home you can easily make faster time and not just that but it helps the environment. Now another advantage of not using cars is businesses start to flourish. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Selsky, par 28. Since many people have decided not to use their cars they walk or bike and that can lead to going to places near by which would mean they see more of their city than they did in a car. More eyes are to catch businesses and they find themselves walking into a store because they aren't rushed andor it might just look intersting which is a huge benefit for companies.

Secondly, another advantage on limiting car usage would be conserving resources. This is a very major step when it comes to the environment and things like these should be enforced for a greener Earth. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Rosenthal, par 5. This is damaging our Earth and the only to prevent it is to limit your car use. Because how it's happening and how it's polluting our Earth is from the cars tailpipes when it releases the exhaust. Due to this hazardly problem laws are starting to be made to limit the use. Towns and cities have tried to come up with a nodriving day to decrease the use and help the environment, and in many cases it has worked while in some, it hasn't. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" Duffer, par 10. In effect to this 'experiment' it is shown that this way of thinking had changed Paris pollution decreased and congestion in traffic was down and the smog that was being created by cars had stopped the next couple of days. It's unbelievable to know what can happen when you limit yourself.

Finally, it is clear that there is a decrease in car culture. There have been recent studies that imply that more Americans aren't driving or just plain out don't want to get their licenses. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..."" Rosenthal, par 41. We aren't really understanding as to why this is happening. Maybe it's because they are afraid of getting a ticket, their parents haven't allowed it, they are against pollution it's not known. But what we do know is that yes, it's saving the environment but it's hurting the car businesses. ""If the pattern presists and many sociologists believe it will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emission, just behind power plants"" Rosenthal, par 34. Yes, this is going to increasingly better our enivornment by not having more cars on the road to pollute, but it will for sure hurt the car industry. Not many people even have the money to go out a buy a car in this economy. And from the car businesses in ruins, some are even rebranding themselves. The change in car culture is known for much less commuting due to technology as well.

Lastly, a reminder of the advantages in limiting car usage are saving time and businesses, conserving resources and a decrease in car culture. So when you're on the road, start thinking about ways to stop your use of cars and see how it would benefit the environment cause the more we drive around the worse our Earth will become."
2cd15a38,0,"In a world of large cities and distant suburbs, transportation is crucial, but is personal transportation truly necessary? Shouldn't there be a way of getting from point A to point B without expending an unnecessary amount of harmful gases that could one day bring around our demise? As specified by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky the answer to these questions is yes. Yes, there is hope for a healthier future without the use of bows, Toyota Corollas, Mercedes, and other modes of personal transportation that pollute the Earth. These answers have been noticed by our World's leaders and they are finally taking initiative to save our planet.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer for the New York Times, Germany is one of the many countries beginning to take notice. This is evident in the building of a small suburb called Vauban where ""life goes on without cars"". Although approximately 30 percent of the residents in Vauban do own a car, it is clear that the 5,500 people living in this small town are happier residing in a place where vehicles do not crowd the streets. As said by a mother living in Vauban ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".

This idea of a ""car reduced"" community is not only seen in Germany but might very well soon be found in other countries such as the United States. These ideas today might just be seen by the public as what they are: ideas. However, serious action must be taken now. Although personal transportation might be seen as a necessity by your average citizen, it is not. Personal vehicles are a luxury that we use at, no only our own risk, but at the risk of everyone forced to breathe the intoxicating fumes of these polluting machines. According to recent data, 12 percent of green house gas emmisions in Europe come from passenger cars but this number is not nearly as shocking as that of the United States: 50 percent!

As stated by Robert Duffer and Andrew Selsky, writers for the Chicago Tribune and Seattle Times, Paris and Bogota have come to understand the consequences of the use of personal cars and are taking small steps to better the circumstances brought on to the human population due to the car pollution. In Paris, however, the city had to undergo a hard blow from reality for the french government to understand how crucial this change is. After suffering near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban on the driving of passenger cars in order to clear the air. If the ban was not respected by an individual, heshe would be forced to pay a 22euro fine. Although there were a few who did not follow the terms of the ban, the majority of the people did comply and the smog soon cleared.

For Bogota, however, the ban of passenger cars for a single day has been seen as more of a holiday. The people of this city have come to enjoy this somewhat stress free day away from cars. According to the Bogota mayor, Antanas Mockus, event the rain has not stopped people from participating in this day. This day is not as small of a step as you might think however. For it is a program set to spread to various countries where, for a single day a year, people will bike, hike, roler blade, etc. In other words, everything they MUST do to get from point A to point B.

Finally, as countries around the world begin to take initiative towards the better of our planet, the United States, one of the world's super powers is starting on it's path towards recovery. In the past years, data has come to support the fact that there truly is a shift in the American ""way of life"". As seen in recent studies, Americans are buying fewer cars , driving less and getting fewer licenses as times goes on. Although the United States peaked in miles driven in 2005 it is evident that, with time, that amount gradually declined and hit a low in April 2013 where the miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. As a cause of this sudden hit on the use of cars researchers are beginning to ask: could the United States truly be entering a new era away from the pollution of passenger vehicels or is this just another phase?

Passenger vehicles and the gases they create could very well be the demise of our existence on Earth. This is unless, as a human poopulation, we begin to take action now. Although scientists everywhere have stressed the negative impact on the Earth brought on by cars, people are blind to see that these vehicles are not a necessity but rather a luxury. For this, it is crucial that countries and leaders around the world follow what others have done and begin to enforce the protection of the planet's health and ensure our survival as a species."
59905bc5,0,"There are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus, plane, train or car. Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air pollution. reducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.

To start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her carless life is the one that makes her happy.

Besides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the environment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the environment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.

Now with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.

The results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done in source 4 and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the environment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage."
85410ec2,1,"Keeping the Electoral College is not smart for the united states voting system. First, many citizens all over the country don't agree with the voting system. Second, the Electoral College may be swayed by bias. Third, citizens do not really have control over their vote. The Electoral College system should be changed.

Many American citizens do not agree with the voting system. Citizens have grievances about the system being unfair and unreasonable. The Office of the Federal Register states, ""It's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" source 1. If American citizens are persistent with the issue, and continue to argue, then why is the government keeping the system? Why doesn't the government come up with a more rational voting system?

The Electoral College's vote may be swayed by bias. How can we trust total strangers with our vote? Bradford Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states source 2. Voters do not get the full effect of voting because they are voting for other ""qualified"" people to vote for them. How is that possibly effective?

Citizens do not have control over their vote. Once citizens vote their vote is out of their hands. The Electoral College chooses the president for them and there is nothing citizens can do about it. Bradford Plumer states, ""Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election"" source 2. The government has full control over how the election goes, not the citizens who voted.

The entire Electoral College system is completely irrational. The government needs to come up with a new way to vote for future presidents that is more fair. If we find a solution to this problem the government will not only gain favor of the American citizens, but also keep the balance that is established by the constitution. The American citizens will have control over their vote. The Electoral College should be abolished."
ab659f57,1,"Dear Senator, The robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please."" Paragraph 11 Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.

Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and ""a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Paragraph 1 by the founding fathers. Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media available, like the internet and television. But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system. ""According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Paragraph 9 Therefore, this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me. The Electoral College is almost universally despised, and not considered the most effective way to elect a President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Paragraph 13 This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote.

Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! Yes, ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" Paragraph 20 Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election. This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smallerimpact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states.

Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" Paragraph 14 Regards, A concerned citizen."
c912a6c3,1,"The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a ""Winnertakesall"" system. This unnecessary and inaccurate use of votes is outdated and needs to be shut down.

In an instant, an electoral college voter could change his or her mind and go against his or her original political party. This is a completely unfair use of power because it reverses all of the votes that went to the elector and to all of the voters who were counting on the elector to properly represent their vote. The voters have no say in whether the elector will stay true to his or her party.

The easiest way to prove that the electoral college must go, is to reveal the facts. In source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College it states ""over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Multiple icons such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO have stated they would like to abolish the electoral college as well! We now have the majority vote to put an end to the electoral college and the unfair system.

""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote,"" says source 2. A tie in the votes, which is very much possible since the total number of votes is 538, according to source 1, could then allow the fate of America to rest in the hands of the House of Representatives, a miniscule representation of the people. If the voting system were to be changed to the popular vote, the results would accurately display the winner that the majority of America chose.

""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer, and he couldn't be closer to the truth. The electoral college system does not represent the people of America accurately and is more likely to result in a tie compared to the popular vote. To conclude, source 3 says the electoral college is ""a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner ""."
07384ce9,0,"I beam, flashing a smile towards the camera of my mom's iPhone. In my hand, I grip a fourbythree inch square of plastic that, in my perspective, is synonymous with freedom. It's the moment every kid dreams about, lying bellydown on the kitchen floor and pushing a Barbie jeep around their mother's feet as she labors away at the stove, the stark scent of garlic filling their little noses. Finally, I got my driver's license! While definitely a defining moment of adolescence, most teenagers refuse to acknowledge the degrading qualities of driving. Limiting car usage has a multitude of benefits, such as decreasing air pollution and improving the health and quality of life of the world's people.

As a new driver, there is nothing I despise more than waking up to severe smog, squinting as I corral my vehicle down blurred roadways en route to school. By utilizing my own vehicle, however, I am adding to the problem. Smog and other forms of unaesthetic air pollution are caused in part by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars tailpipe. In the United States, passenger cars are responsible for up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. Source 1 Another large percentage of these emissions comes from the inefficient, energywasting, carbonspewing processes required to create gasoline and diesel fuel. Essentially, we emit large amounts of greenhouse gases to produce fuel for our vehicles which, in turn, release more greenhouse gases. As an AP Environmental Science student, I know better than anyone the degrading results of excessive greenhouse gases. As these particles accumulate in the atmosphere, light from the sun, including harmful ultraviolet rays, stays trapped in our planet, causing a gradual rise in average temperature. This process is known as global warming. Besides being dangerous to our planet, air pollution is unappealing visualy to all inhabitants of Earth. Smog once reached such high levels in Paris, the capital of France, that a partial driving ban was placed on the city to purify the air. After one day of diminishing the number of cars on the roads by 50%, the smog had cleared enough for civilians to continue their daily activities. Source 2 The grotesque images associated with smog can harm Paris' economy tourists want to view the Palace of Versailles with a tear in their eye from its beauty, not from the sting of air pollutants.

Limiting car usage also has a variety of physical and psycological benefits that improve the health of earth's people. For example, a suburban community in Germany, known as Vauban, has gone completely carfree. 57% of Vauban's residents sold a car to move in and, so far, the majority of them seem to be enjoying the benefits. Heidrun Walker, a media trainer and mother of two, is one of them. ""When I had a car, I was always tense,"" she said, ""I'm much happier this way."" Source 1 Walker's statement shows the improved psychological wellbeing of those who do not rely on cars for the majority of their transportation. Decreased reliance on motor vehicles can also improve the physical health of humanity. Without personalized vehicles for transportation, many people will walk, jog, bike, or skate to their various destinations. Such a phenomenon occurs annually in Bogota, the capital of Columbia. Every year, they host a ""Day Without Cars"", during which Columbians rely on their own two feet to move about their sprawling city. Source 3 Physical activities such as walking have a variety of benefits, including increased cardiovascular health. If more countries hosted events similar to Bogota's ""Day Without Cars"", emergency rooms may find they have less clogged arteries to deal with.

Limiting car usage has many pros, including decreased air pollution and increased mental and physical wellbeing of the world's people. The next time you unlock your car to drive two minutes to your friend's house, stop and consider the consequences of your actions. Consider the health of yourself and your planet, and try walking instead."
666737e7,1,"Voting, one of the most American things I can thing of. This is a democracy, and we have the right to vote for our leader, but not really. There is a thing called the Electoral College, and the electors that you vote for actually vote for the president. Although this does not seem fair, it is a great system. Almost every time your state votes for an Elector, he picks the President that your state wants. So it really is a great deal.

My opponents belive that the president should be voted by popular vote, but i disagree. Richard Posner, writer for slate magazine writes that this method is nondemocratic, and should be overruledsource 3, paragraph 15. Although you are not actually voting for president, you are voting for who votes for president. This method equals out the playing field for states. Insted of all the power going to states like California or Texas. Presidents have to fight for every state. Posner also writes, sometimes the person with the popular vote will not win the election, like in 2000source 3, paragraph 16. Although this was a huge disaster, it was the first time something like this has happened since 1888. Also, 4 years later George Bush won the election again, but for real.

Some may say that America is not filled with the smartest, or brightest people. So you belive that we should hold the fate of who will be president in the hands of an adult who cant spell his own name. Someone ike that has as much power as a guy who has watched every debate, and has done research. So by voting for a democrate elector, your state will vote for a democratic president, if your state votes in a republican elector, then your state will vote for a republican president. It is as simple as that.

The Electoral college provides a point system for every state. the biggest are California with 55, and Texas with 38. The smallest are the dakota, and they each are worth 3 points. The point system is based on population, and how many representatives you have. One of the best parts of this is that every state get attention. Without this system, the candidates would only go to campien at the highest populated states. Then this would cause the smaller states to think that their votes don't matter, and then one day we are going to have a bad guy as our leader.

In conclusion, I belive the Electoral College is a great system, and I hope it lives on. Although it is not really Democratic, it still is a better system than what my oppents belive we should do. This gives us a certantity of oucome, a president that everyone supports, swing states, big states, and helps to avoid runoff elections. So Senator, if you back the Ellectoral College, maybe we will vote you as our next President."
295dd4ed,1,"The Electoral College, good or bad? Many may feel that the Electoral College has more downs than ups, but thats not always the case. I feel that despite these common views we should keep the electoral college due to the fact that popular vote may not always be the best way.

There have been multiple instances in which the electoral college has saved many elections due to the fact that the popular vote was too close. This ""college"" consists of multiple slates of electors. These electors are really who we vote for when we vote for president. Every states including the District of Columbia are allocated a certain amount of electors. These electors then vote for whoever won the popular vote in that state despite the other sides views. This is called a ""winnertakeall"" system. Yet there are two states, Maine and Nebraska, that have a ""proportional representation"" system. When it is done the governor creates a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which basically is the official way of declaring who in that state won the vote.

The Electoral College is more good then bad due to the fact that it has saved instances of a tight vote. The Electoral College does require the presidential candidates to abide by some rules. One of which is making the candidate focus on other areas rather than the region they know they will win the vote in. Another like i have been talking about is the outcome, it enables a balance that should be kept between the popular votes. It is also another way like the two houses of Congress where it keeps the balance of political choice between big states and small states. It also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

Now many may find it that the electoral college are beings from a bottomless pit because of the year 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush with Al Gore winning with over 60% of the popular vote. This is most likely due to the reason why he mmay have stretched out all of his visits between the states. He may have won more popular votes in total than Bush but he may have appealed to a minority of people in each state so the overall of the state wanted Bush. Some say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor. Just because some may choose not to vote for the person they are supposed to doesnt mean that the entire college is bad. These things are going to happen with people who think differently. Just because someone may think McDonald's is nasty and they refuse to go are you going to not go because they don't? This happens in everything we do we are only human, we are different, not everyone thinks in the same way. When we do it is a recipe for disaster.

So, in my opinion, we must keep the electoral college if we want to keep the balance in everything the US stands for, politically and demographically. These are facts that should not be ignored, just because some see differently doesn't mean we have to change the foundation of our society."
ae289cee,1,"Every four years america as a whole chooses on who should be the president of the united states. The process of election is straight forward and always follows the same process every election. The american citizens vote on one of the two candidates, then those votes are counted and giving to the electors, then the electors of each state representing the population of said state including the District of Columbia votes one of the candidates, after all votes are tallied the winning candidate is elected president. Overall this system seems rather complicated and can be seen as an unfair process at which only to vote on who takes charge of america. The electoral college should be replaced by who receives the most popular votes from all american citizens and not the state electoral.

Electoral college is a process created during the founding of the united states as sort of a ""middleground"" or compromise on how the people of the country should elect the president . In order for a president to be elected out of the 538 electors that make up the electoral college he or she must at least receive 270 votes . Each president has a group of electors that process your votes in order to choose who the state votes for making it in a ways unfair. This system can come with its own set of problems that include replacement of electors, electors voting to who they feel, and at times one candidate gaining the most popular vote but losing the chance of presidency because of the lack of electoral votes form the state . An example of the unbalanced power is the near success of the louisiana legislature replacing the democratic electors in the 1960, segregation with new ones that would oppose against John F. Kennedy making him lose the popular vote.

The best replacement for the electoral college is to allow the citizens of america to vote upon who should be the president of the U.S without the need for electors. The candidate that receives the most votes is the one who becomes the president of the united states. In order to process all possible millions of votes into a rational percentage and the candidate with the higher percentage would in turn become president. With this in mind the candidates would need to visit all or largely selected states in order to deliver campaign speeches to persuade the population to vote for them, because with the electoral college system candidates would focus mainly on tight races in the ""swing states"" practically ignoring other like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see their candidate . The electoral college only focuses on the large numbers and not on the smaller population that can still make a difference making the system unfair. Making them only focus on the big states because how many electoral votes it could bring compared to a smaller state which could possibly only supply three.

On the other side electoral college does have a good standing as a method of vote. Electoral college has five good reasons on why it shouldn't be replaced and they are certainty of outcom, everyone's president, swing states, Big states, and avoid runoff elections . Each campaign party chooses their electors which rarely end in betrayel making it possible to win the election with low popularity votes. The electoral system also gives the candidate a chance to win in a ""landslide"" because of the winnertakeall basis at which it follows . No region has enough votes to elect a president also the electoral college needs to have transregional appeal. And the main goal of the electoral college is to obviously elect a new president but as well avoid runoff elections.

The electoral college is an unfair system of voting because of how it all depends on a small group of selected representatives and not all of the american population as a whole. Even though it can be regarded as a fair middle ground it still has its flaws and doesnt reach out to society as a whole only focusing on the states that can lead to victory, casting out those who's electoral votes will not make much of a difference. In the end the voting system should mainly focus on popularity of a candidate than what the ""state"" feels they should vote for because of how many votes they actually received for a given candidate due to the fact that it may end up voting on which who they feel and refuse to vote for their partys candidate. The electoral system should be replaced."
89c49ee9,0,"Ever since it was first invented, the automobile has proved to be very important and practical for people all over the globe. In the current century, however, the demand for the car has begun to see a potential disappearance, as people are beginning to discover that there are advantages to minimizing their dependence on their vehicles. Limiting car usage has several very influential advantages, such as increasing mental health, reducing air pollution, and eliminating problems associated with traffic.

First of all, studies have proven that the use of automobiles is linked to the levels of stress and unhappiness that people feel. Source one elaborates on this by discussing a city in Germany that decided to give up cars. It quotes a woman who says that when she had a car she was always tense, but living in Vauban the car free city has made her much happier. She is able to walk or bike everywhere that she needs to be in town. This opportunity to increase happiness is also mentioned in source three, which quotes a businessman who says that limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress."" The alternative he choses is to ride a tandem bike with his wife. This allows for more bonding with his wife as well as increasing their physical health, which plays a vital role in mental health as well.

As of recently, the impact that cars have on the environment has gained more attention as well as increased concern. All vehicles emit greenhouse gasses, which are very harmful to the environment, causing smog and damage to the atmosphere. According to source one, limiting the use of passenger cars could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent. Source two describes how the accumulation of smog in Paris became so bad that it caused official bans on the use of cars. It took an entire week of restricting car usage to get the smog to clear up. Source four also agrees that the results of limiting car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Source one mentions that as a result of all of this, the Enviromental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting car reduced communities.

Lastly, limiting car usage eliminates all problems associated with traffic. Traffic creates many problems for people, from increasing danger to wasting time. Limiting car usage would immidately reduce traffic substantially. This could prevent people from being stuck on their way home during rushhour every day. Having cars speeding by, in residential areas especially, increases the level of danger for pedestrians. There are many casualties that happen every year due to automobile accidents. Limiting car usage would easily eliminate this problem. It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."
684b8b22,0,"To get from point A to point B, whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movies, the logical answer that pops up in everyone's mind seems to be a car. automobiles such as cars and motorcycles are widely used and are integrated into every part of society. But do automobiles really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society? Cars and motorcycles create a myriad of problems such as congestion and smog. Some societies even legally limit their community's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problems. Limiting automobile usage is important, because not only is it practiced globally with tremendous success, but it also largely reduces pollution caused by diesel fuel and brings to light issues within communities and accounts for their resolution.

Automobiles are thought of as a daily commodity in most urban countries, but there are some societies in which usage has been reduced or even eliminated entirely and the positive results may be shocking. In the suburban city Vauban, Germany, residents have given up automobiles for a chance at a life free of traffic sounds and stress. This experimental journey within the town has achieved these and so much more. Their streets are essentially carfree and the lack of garages and parking space allows for up to 5,500 people to live in a single rectangular square mile with any necessary stores within walking distance Source 1 Par 6. similarlyyet on a much smaller scale, Bogota, Columbia has initiated a carfree day in an attempt to eliminate the area's pollution as well as reduce stress. The day is on its third year and has done as hoped. Additionally, Bogota's once pitted and uneven sidewalks have been since replaced and made much smoother, and the city has introduced parks and sports centers, new restaurants, and new shopping centers which are blossoming and thriving Source 4 Par 28. these changes have created a society both happy and strongly bonded. As wonderful as these positive shifts in society are, limiting automobile usage can do even more.

A limit in automobile usage can also benefit communities by reducing pollutionseeing as a large majority of air pollution is created through the release of diesel fuels into the air. Paris, France legally banned personally automobile use throughout the city in order to rid the city's air of harsh pollutants Source 2 Par 10. France experiences a combination of cold nights and warm days that trap the emmisions from cars, scooters, and motorcycles Source 2 Par 15. By significantly reducing the amount of diesel fuels rising to the air to be trapped, the smog had cleared enough within mere weeks that the city was able to entirely lifted the ban. This is a major example of the advantages limiting car usage entails.

Altogether, limiting automobile usage is key to improving society and has myriad advantages such as creating a more bonded and pleasant community and reduces environmental hazards like pollution. Creating vehicular limits is a promising way to change the world as we know it for the better."
945de5f3,1,"Our country, the United States of America, needs and deserves a grand president who will work hard and inspire the citizens of this country to persevere like our forefathers have and this president needs to be voted by popular vote by hisher citizens in the United States. The presidential elections need to be of popular vote and to be voted by the citizens of America, not by some electoral college. The reason for this is that for one: the candidates ignore the smaller states, two: electors who are chosen can, and possibly will, go against the will of the people the Electoral College shows signs of inequality amongst the states, unpatrioticism, and unfairness.

If we continue to go by the electoral college, the smaller states who hold inadequate populations will continue to be ignored by the candidates running for presidency. In source 1 paragraph No. 3, it states:""Your states allotment of the electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives and 2 for your Senators."" Also, in paragraph 13 of Source No.2, it states,"" Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" So, the candidates ignore the smaller states because of their smaller population and this is a sign of unfairness and inequality amongst the people of America. The future president should address and obtain votes that are from all 50 states of the United States. That is how we treat and show that every person and every state are equal to one another, and that the candidates get an honest and fair vote. The way the Electoral College does things during the presidential election is everything against how our country came to be through hardwork, a desire and wish to be equal to one another, and to ensure fairness amongst the people this Electoral College projects an unpatriotic feel and that itself should not be a process that the United States holds.

The Electoral College is unfair in the fact that the electors chosen by our state legislature can, and possibly will go against the will of the people. With the Electoral College those who vote aren't actually voting for the president but for a slate of electors that elect the president. In Source No.2 paragraph 11, it states: ""In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This is unfair and a disrespect to a persons choice. It is an act that is untrustworthy and it could happen at any time, people might not even know it. That action practically takes away a citizens right of opinion speech which is part of the Bill of Rights, the very basis of what we have a right to have. That in itself is unAmerican and unpatriotic. This system should be overruled and abandoned for it doesn't go with the basis of our country's ways.

However, the Electoral College does have a somewhat strict rule that is rarely broken. In Source No.3 paragraph 16, it states:"" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for that party's nominee and that trust is rarely broken.."" The Electoral College does have some points that it is not totally untrustworthy. But, this point can be broken and can be unfair for the people.

Senator, I hope these points have shown that the Electoral College needs to be voted against due to its unfairness, unpatrioticness, and its act of inequality amongst the states. This country needs it's people to vote for it's president, not a slate of electors."
2ce175d8,0,"Cars are becoming a dying trend all over the world. More and more people choose to walk, ride bikes, take busses, or use alternative forms of transportation. Car companies seem to be losing business also. With more and more drives becoming pedestrians each day, it seems that private automobiles will soon be replaced by the old method of transportation, walking. This new option of transportation seems to be becoming a trend everywhere.

Less cars means less pollution. Major cities that are filled with cars seem be becoming more and more polluted each day. Big cities such as paris have taken major action, such as to temporarily ban driving, to reduce smog production. An article from the Chicago Tribune states""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""10. Pollution is becoming a big problem all over the world. Alternative transportation is one way you can help stop the pollution all over the world.

More exercise is allowed without cars. without cars, people are forced to get up and move to their destination instead of just sitting down your whole life. Obesity is becoming a big problem now all over the world but it has a very big impact in America. More people need more exercise and getting rid of cars is an excellent solution. Even with riding a bus, you would have to get up and walk to the bus stop. Alternative transportation could be the new big thing in exercise.

You can save money without a car. Due to inflation, cars cost a ludacris amount of money in modern day. People spend their whole lives trying to pay off an automobile. Not only do you have to pay off the Automobile itself but you must also pay for the gas, parts, and tools that come with it, which price continues to rise. It is also getting harder to find money and jobs as unemployment also rises while many salaries fall. It is very important to save your money and current day and maybe spend it on something more useful than an automobile.

As automobiles begin to become scarce among many counties, more and more benefits come with alternative transportation. The benefits of being able to save money, the ability to get in physical shape and to exercise more, and the ability to be smog free are all extremely important in today's society and environment. Automobile businesses are even thinking of partnering with other companies that produce products such as bikes, busses, or even making more sidewalks for pedestrians with alternative transportation. Our economy may be falling but our enviorment is flourishing. Giving up cars and Alternative transportaion may be the next big thing. Use alternative transportation to save our earth and for the benefits that come along with it."
e4eef26b,1,"""Do you want to be apart of a Electoral College"" Electoral colleges. Do you know what this means? An electoral college is a process of multiple facts. Not a place. As everyone thinks Electoral College sounds deceiving because the word ""college"" in the name but apparently thats not true. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President and votes by the people of America. Dear Senator, this is where I begin rambling on and on about how the electoral college is wonderful and great. But I am just going to let you in to alittle bit of knowledge behind the thinking, before you get your fingers in a knot. I propose that we shall keep the Electoral college in order to keep things fair amoung the country. Lets get talking shall we.....

The Electoral college is all high and mighty and is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. During the meeting of the electors, they discuss the presidents and vice presidents that are trying out for there 'role' in society. They also align the counting of the electoral votes by the Congress men. If you did not know Senator the Electoral College or as we call it ""EC"" consists of 538 electors in the so called 'pole'. A majority of those electors are 270 votes that are required to elect the President. There is one allotment for each member of the House of Representatives adding an extra 2 for your senators, like you! As you can see the ""EC"" has alot to offer and your even included. Why would you want to get rid of something that your apart of! Wait a second you don't know the rest of the story do you. Well now I understand why you wouldn't want them to just be another organization. Am I Right?

Each candidate running for the high quality name known as ""The president"" in your state has his or hers own group of electors. They are usually chosen by the political party, but the state laws vary from time to time. Fun Fact for Mr. Senator did you know this is in the 23rd Amendment? Oh silly me your the senator you should know this! Continuing on with our little debate here there is an important part of the Electoral colleges that you must know. Every tuesday after the first monday in November is when these elections occur. And if you didn't think that the citizens have a say in this at all, well you are mistaken! The citizens help choose the your states electors because when you vote for President your actually voting for your candidates electors. So they do have a say in this partake.

""Winner Take All"" sound familiar to you. Maybe not but I am going to explain it anyway. The Winner Takes All System awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Except for the unlucky ones like Maine, and Nebraska they have something called the ""Proportional Representation"". All said and done the ""certificate of Ascertainment"" is introduced after the elction has partaken in. This lists all of the candidates who ran for President in your state choosen along with the names of there ""side kick"" the electors. This shows who will be in your country running for president and elector for the next 4 years until the next election.

Of course the ""EC"" has some problems which of course you would like to hear so I will state them as well. Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the US Chamber of Commerce want to abolish the ""EC""! They are not alone on this one. Whats wrong with the electoral college you say? Under the ""EC"" voters vote for something other than the president but for the slate of electors, who then turn over andelect who ""THEY"" want to be the president. This is why we have the voting we have today so each person can vote on who they want and still be treated the same. But it can also make a crisis to.

Allowing the people to vote for whoever they want to is not a good idea. It can lead to bigger problems and issues. Voting for yourself can be very, very stressful. Adding on top of more strees. Of course its easier this way but your electing who is going to be the ""President"". Someone who controlls your country, tells YOU what to do, and makes new laws. It shouldn't be as easy as writting on a piece of paper who you want to be president. There should be some type of way to make it alittle more precise. This is why there is the Electoral College. All you have to do is get with someone you trust and vote for them to be apart of the candidates electors. Then all they have to do is vote for who they want to be president and see what happens. Its just as easy as what we have now but alittle bit more neatclean. I Know I am spilling alot of information onto you about the ""EC"". And the advantages and disadvantages of having it. But I ask you to read this letter and think about what role YOU play in this election. Write back to me in your response of the actions you are going to be risking.

Sincerely, Yours trulyMs."
f8c16bbe,1,"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, ""... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency."" The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."
39a9ae49,0,"Could you imagine your life without a car? It seems impossible if cars wouldn't exist. Did you know that there are cities where people have'nt used their cars for a whole day? While in others people dont ever use cars. People think that without a car they're nothing, and that life is totally different. But there is something very interesting happening around us, in other countries which is the reason why they've stopped using cars for a while. The polluted air due to cars in doing no good for us. Think about it, maybe you could might live without are car for a day for an important cause.

First thing first, we should learn how people live in other countries without a car. It sounds weird to us, but it's something normal for them. There is forbidden to have home garages and to park cars on street in Vauban, Germany. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, Germany has gone from a city with cars to people giving up their cars. ""street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders""Rosenthal, paragraph 2. This place is ""car free"" except for the downtown area and a few streets of the community. She also states that other countries like the US experiments more problems in pollution.""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the US""5. People walk way more in Europe, they dont suffer much from air pollution.

Additionally, Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. These cities have stopped using their cars for a while to help calm the air pollution. ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31"" Robert Duffer, paragraph 11. Although that people were not supposed to us ehtier cars that day, 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. The cause for not driving for that day was because the cold nights and warm days caused the air to trap car emissions. Another reason for car free in Paris is because of the micrograms found. ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London, Rueters found""Duffer, 17. Its an advantage to prevent car usage because the smog is clearing in these cities.

In similarity, millions of Colombians hiked, walked and did many other activities without touching a car to prevent the smog. These cities are working together to make the world a better place. ""In a program that set's to spread to toher countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday""Andrew Selsky, paragraph 20. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, and they achived it. That day without a car was an improvement camapign in Bogota. Surprsingly, in the US recent studies have stated that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less each year that goes by. ""if the pattern persists and many sociologists believ it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the environment""Elizabrth Rosenthal, paragarph 34. There has also been changes in the US. Driving less has stopped air pollution.

In conclusion there are benefits without a car. Benefits for the world around us, and well you might get some stress out if you start walking, hiking, or riding bycicles for a while. It's incredible just to think of the idea that many countries have stopped driving for a day to make their country or city a better place. While in cities like Vauban, Germany people live without cars. Thats what makes their city different. Even though they do also let these things happen for a right cause. I think that we could live without a car for one day, it's not a big deal, really. It's to make the US a better place."
0f235c4f,0,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage and many people are starting to see it. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal She goes to explain that in Vauban, Germany there is a community that have given up on cars. Without a car on the streets you can tell its more lively with the quote ""Heidrun walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked berdants streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" With that quote from the article you can tell that the streets are filled with the sound of people rather than the sound of motors and smoke from the vehicles.

certainly not having cars is a great advantage to suburbs, in Rosenthal article it said "" there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking... in attempt to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation... in this new approach, stores are placed a walk away..."" Instead of wasting gas and filling the air with disgusting gas, stores could be just around the corner. Which in return would be easier for everyone around. Even the united states, environmental protection agency is promoting""car reduced"" communities.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is to reduce smog and air pollution, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robery duffer he informs us that paris actually enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It stated "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... the smog rivaled Bejing,china, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" By banning driving they not only were able to reduce the smog and air pollution, They obviously reduced car traffic!

Also In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, they banned car in an effort to promote alternative transportation and reduce spog. In the article is said ""parks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad , smooth sidewalks rushhouse restrictins have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants andupscale shopping districts have cropped up."" The day also is said to help lower stress, "" It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air population,""said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.

As you can tell from the facts within this essay, there are definitly many advantages with limiting car usage, from reducing smog and pollution, to having stores built closer to home. These advantages not only help the citzens but also the planet we live on, and our future children and their children and so on..."
343db895,1,"Dear state senator, to the people voting is the most important part of politics. You out of all people speak politics, so you should understand. Keeping the electoral college would be many more great successful years in voting because of the certainty of outcome, it would take care of the swing and big states, and it avoids runoff elections.

Disputes over the outcomes of an electoral vote is possible. The winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds the popular vote. In other words in 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the votes while rodney received only 51.3, and because almost all of the states award winnertakesall even a slight chance of popularity could change the results. It is very unlikely for this to happen. Although there are many things wrong with the electoral college like making peoples votes not exactly count, it is something to figure out.

For the swing and big states, the voting is slightly different. The voters in the tossup states tend to pay more attention to the campaign than any other place. They really get into the whole campaign and really listen to all of what the competing candidates say and do. For the big states, the electoral college does them a favor and gives them more electoral candidates. It restores the weight in the balance that large states lose by virtue.

The electoral college does us a big favor by avoiding runoff situations, that could lead tomoe complicated situations. The runoff election occurs when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes casted. These runoff elections cause a lot of pressure, and surely does complicate the presidential election.

In conclusion, staying with the electoral college process, it would maintain our problems of eunoff elections, certainty of the outcome and the big and swing issues."
d3c0d00b,0,"Many people believe that owning and using a car or other motorized vehicles is an advantage. But is it really? Citizens might be able to get somewhere faster or not have to exert the energy to get there. But is it worth polluting the air, taking up all that space and creating traffic and frustrated citizens, and creating the mindset of a lazy, human being? Maybe instead of spending money on a car, citizens wouldn't be in as much debt, some kids might have college already paid for, and some citizens have their housing paid for. Therefor, this is making happier, stressfree, citizens.

The pollution of the air is a major argument for people who support the nonusage of cars or other motorized vehicles. In Source 1: In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal claims that motorized vehicles play a major part in the pollution of the air. Rosenthal says that Europe is responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the United States is responsible for up to 50 percent.

Most of the time, traffic causes a driver to be frustrated. What causes traffic? Vehicles. So why does everybody drive them? In small, wellpopulated suburbs, traffic is a major issue. With the dense population and the majority of those citizens driving vehicles, traffic is very easily created. Thus, making more citizens frustrated and creating road rage. Road rage also causes more accidents which causes more deaths. Making driving, a dangerous thing. Although, citizens still drive motorized vehicles. Most of the time it is to get to a certain place in a short amount of time, but if a destination is closer than one mile, there is no excuse to use a vehicle to get there. But most citizens do. This creates a lazy mind set.

The average cost of a brand new car is roughly 30,000. If citizens avoid buying a car, it would be a great benefit for them. 30,000 can payoff college, or help with bills or debt, or payoff housing. With more money, this creates happier, and less stressed citizens.

The creation of ""car dues"", and ""carfree days"" could make a huge difference in the environment, economy, safety, traffic, and even the health and stress of a citizen. Although most people still believe that having a car is an advantage, it can be. But not having a car or not using a car as much is a much greater advantage. Not just to an individual, but to society as a whole."
b1fdbd7d,1,"Dear State Senate, I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States president because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.

Source two talks about the electoral college and how the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine, the text says, ""... according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

paragraph twentythree, ""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can."
3551684d,1,"Dear Senator of Florida, Though longstanding and ""fair"" to both citizens and Congress, the Electoral College is completely unnecessary and faulty. Election by popular vote is much more practical and leaves room for less errors. First off, the Electoral College warps the perception of voting, for when citizens vote, it is not directly for the president. Also, the Electoral College leaves many loopholes, which cause many issues and disputes.

To start off, the Electoral College does not allow citizens to vote directly, like a true democracy. This is unfair, unjust, outdated, and irrational. The natural right of a citizen should be to directly vote for something of a passionate matter. Controversies are everywhere, and citizens should be able to have a direct say in what is done. In What Is the Electoral College?, the Office of the Federal Register declares, ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" 1.6. This seems quite indirect and faulty. Can the electors be trusted? We do not know and we definitely do not want to find out. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, ""...according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" 2.9.

Moving on, the Electoral College also contains many loopholes in the system. It is very possible to have issues arise. Electors can become faithless, the number of electors for a certain state can be controversial, and legislatures can ""defy the will of the people."" In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John. F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy"" 2.11. This unfortunate fact really shows how faulty the electoral college system really is. Do we really want so many loopholes when it comes to choosing the person who will run our country?

One may say that the electoral college has less disputes than that of just the popular vote. In In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president , Richard A. Posner says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote"" 3.18. However, this is untrue in my opinion. The Electoral College has already created so much controversy and dissension, along with faults and problems. For the wellbeing of our country, it would be best to simply get rid of the Electoral College alltogether.

Overall, the Electoral College should not exist choosing the president should rely on simply the popular vote. The Electoral College is not a direct way for citizens to vote, which shows signs of America not being a true democracy. Also, the Electoral College has many loopholes that are sources of dispute and issues in America. To sum it up, this method of choosing the president, is irrational, unfair, unjust, and outdated. The Electoral College should be abolished."
44558f42,0,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Decreasing the amount of time citizens use personal motorvehicles positively impacts the environment and the state of mind of people. The lack of driving personal cars is becoming more widely accepted in several countries for different reasons. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, is an experimental district testing the lifestyle that does not use cars. Paris banned driving for environmental reasons, and Bogota decided to try it out too. Also, it is a trend in America for the purpose of saving money and because there are other convenient options.

The decrease in fumes from cars is very beneficial to the environment. People and organizations are making drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. According to paragraph five of ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" twelve percent of greenhouse gas in Europe is caused by passenger cars and fifty percent in some areas of the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities because emissions from cars contributes to half of the pollution in America. In the Article by Robert Duffer, ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" he describes the event that Paris had to declare a ban on half of the drivers because the large amount of smog that lingered over Paris. Colombia even has a day dedicated to being free of cars to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. All of these events show the severity of environmental problems caused by cars and people making efforts to promote a better environment.

Also, a decrease in personal motor vehicles causes people to have a better state of mind. Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" With a car comes a lot of responsibility which leads to a lot of stress on a person. Not having a car is one less bill to pay and thing to take care of which for many people is a better way of living.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" stated Carlos Arturo Plaza on carfree day in Bogota, Colombia. The car free day has also promoted other things to bloom in the city such as parks, sidewalks, and restaurants that people really enjoy. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article ""The End of Car Culture,"" her children have other priorities than recieving their license because they have other things they would rather focus on that they enjoy more. All of these things promote people living a healthier and happier life.

Overall, limiting car usage is a ""winwin"" situation for everyone. Decreasing fumes and the stress of a car causes the environment and people to be happier. Promoting public trasportation or other ways of getting places is better for everyone. It is a growing trend all over the world, and for a good reason. A lack of fumes from cars will clear the air, and clear the minds of fellow citizens."
456f57a7,1,"Dear Florida Senator, The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.

I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Source 1 However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. Some state laws vary Source 1 If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""Source 3 In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.

This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have ""trust that is rarely betrayed"" Source 3 you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" Source 2 If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.

""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" Source 2 In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. Source 2 The Electoral College also follows the ""Winnertakeall"" method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though ""the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", as said by those who believe in the Electoral College Source 3 what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.

I know that politics are filled with misconceptions and many confusing roles and aspects but please consider my thoughts and words. I speak for the voiceless and my fellow neighbors, but most importantly I speak for what our government was founded upon, WE THE PEOPLE."

783256be,0,"Many cities are experiencing perhaps the biggest economic change being implemented into society since the invention of the Model T. People just simply aren't interested in attaining a personal vehicle, or even a license for that matter. As a result, many personal vehicle companies are starting to become more ""mobile"" to stay with the times, or become bankrupt due to being stagnant in sales. Not owning a car has actually proved to come with more advantages than if owning a car. Such as, less carbon emissions in the air, less stress in certain communities where carfree zones are being implemented, and finally restaurants and stores becoming more ""cropped up"" due to rushhour restrictions essentially boosting the economy.

The lack of car use has fundamentally benefitted the environment as an entirety. Cars emit carbon emissions into the air that are not only harmful to many animals, but to humans as well. According to Source 2, in Paris, France alone, it was shown that ""due to the use of diesel fuel over regular fuel, there were 147 micrograms of particle matter per cubic meter."" Comparing this to other major cities in Europe that find more use for regular gasoline, you'll find that the results are less. In Brussels, there were 114 micrograms of PM per cubic meter, and in London, 79.7. Even though areas that used more regular fuel over diesel fuel were significantly lower in micrograms of particle matter, even 79.7 micrograms can be potentially fatal, and cause lungrelated health problems in the later lives of the people occupying these areas. Officials not only in Paris, but also in major cities such as Bogota, Colombia and New York City, New York have also began to take a stand. In Paris, France for example, ""there are certain days in which cars cannot be driven by people with license plates ending in even numbers, and the next day by people with license plates ending in odd numbers. This new way of thinking has been implemented into the French law system to help decrease the amount of pollution in the air."" Source 2 Bogota has also found a unique approach to a less polluted environment. ""Carfree day is a day in which no cars are driven, with the exception of buses and taxis."" Source 3 Finally, New York City has implemented a ""new bikesharing program in which bicycles can be rented for a costeffective amount. In addition to this, bridge and tunnel tolls have also reflected these new priorities by skyrocketing in price."" Source 4 These new implementations have proved beneficial in decreasing the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Many communities have not only found a way to reduce pollution in the air, but also live a more stressfree lifestyle.

Stress and rushhour are known to have some corollation, but newer communities are starting to take a stand by limiting the amount of car usage in their area. Vauban, Germany, a newer community only just established in 2006, is an example of one of these communities that has started to ""smart plan."" Over 70 percent of Vauban's occupants don't own a car, and 57 percent have sold a car to move there."" Source 1 A happier lifestyle has appeared as a result. According to Heidrun Walter, an occupant in Vauban. When she had a car, she was always ""tense."" But now, she's a much happier mother of two, and the distant hum of an occasional motor vehicle is drowned out by the ""chattering of wandering children."" Source 1 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA is suggesting that we start implementing these ""car reduced"" communities in our nation to better society, as well as to provide a more stressfree environment for these new communities' residents. Source 1 Even in Bogota, people have said that the use of no cars is a ""great opportunity that has taken away stress and lowered air pollution."" Source 3 Not only has pollution been reduced in all of this or the fact that a factor attributing to stress has also been removed, but areas where these communities are starting to form, have also boosted the economy. In Bogota, it has been reported that due to Carfree day, that both ""parks and sports centers have started to appear throughout the city. In additon to this, sidewalks have been replaced by more broad, smooth sidewalks. As well as, rushhour traffic has been cut, allowing new restaurants and upscale shopping districts to flourish."" Source 3 ""Cars are starting to become a thing of the past,"" according to Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. Even her children 19 and 21 don't have licenses. ""They say they're interested, but it's not a priority for them,"" she later goes on to say. As a result, gas money is saved, and people can spend more money on things that matter to them.

In conclusion, it has been displayed that the advantages of not using a car are starting to outweight the benefits. The lack of car use in these carfree communities is helping to reduce stress and tension on the road, boost not only the community's economy, but also the entire nation's economy as well. In addition to this, the lack of car use is also helping to preserve the environment, by reducing carbon emissions into the air. According to many sociologists and business professionals, the downfall of the car may well be on its way, but it may not be such a bad thing."
0a62093d,0,"Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the politicians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily bases. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its' streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this ""carfree"" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anticar revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticeably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever growing ""carfree"" city club by starting a program that sponsors a carfree day once a year.

Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completely inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundance of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emersed into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its' residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the contructions of highways and such. When reading the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation.

Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnessasary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 14. While Paris officials wanted to completely eradicate driving completely so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completely banned all at once. To help illiminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its' citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether or not it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty two euro fine. According to the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illiminated in Paris after that week.

After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogota, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completely banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article ""CarFree Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selskey in paragragh 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogota in the mid1990s according to the article titled ""CarFree Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in paragrapgh 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogota have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicyce paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city.

Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article ""The End Of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time then to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to carpooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country."
1f3224ab,1,"The Electoral College has been around for many years. It is not an actual college, or location. It is a process where American citizens select their electors, however proceeding that the electors make their votes for President and Vice President Congress counts for electoral votes. But, the Electoral College is a very controversial process, many people are for it, but many are also against it. Some even wanting to get rid of the Electoral College overall. We should ban the Electoral College for it does not satisfy American people.

Electors in the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, giving American people the wrong idea and vote for the wrong presidential candidate. In the article source 2 ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This quote from the article shows that not always can the American people be guaranteed who their electors vote for, and electors can give voters the wrong information and vote for the opposing candidate. This would be going against American people, dissatisfying them. In the article source 3 by Richard A. Posner it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" American people can be confused, infused with the wrong information by Electors, and vote for a candidate that has no interest in carrying their state.

Larger states get more attention than the smaller states due to their high number of electoral votes. In the article source 3 by Richard A. Posner it says, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Obama had won 29 electoral votes in Florida high number due to him making speeches and campaigns throughout the state. Paying his upmost attention to that state due to the high number of electoral votes he was trying to gain. Whereas in a smaller state such as Wyoming, he would not want to waste time paying much attention there where he can only gain 3 electoral votes! This is simply unfair and at most dissatisfying for the citizens who live in the smaller states with low electoral votes such as Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, etc.

The Electoral College has been around for a long time, and in the end we DO receive a president in the end. But, imagine if this unfairness keeps going every four years an election happens. American people not being guaranteed their candidate, smaller states not getting as much campaign as the larger ones, etc. We do though, receive a president in the end. But what if it's a president that we do not want? That we were not fairly given? Just look at what happened with George Bush! There are many simple advantages to the Electoral College, but there are also many concerns that can outnumber.

The Electoral College should be gotten rid of because of how unfair it is to American citizens. If the issues with the Electoral College are not taken care of in the present, just imagine what our future elections will be like. Us American people need to take a stand against the Electoral College, and the process involved. Once a new popular process is created and introduced, it can provide us more justice and fairness than the Electoral College."
cb2a22f1,0,"You and I both know very well that we love to breath fresh air. Going out into the forest and taking a big breath of what is called ""fresh air."" Why cant we get that in an everyday life? I'll tell you why, because of polution. Cars are a ginormous part of polution, so what if we drove less?

In Vauban, Germany they have given up cars almost completely. The streets in Vauban are ""car free."" If you want a car, you have to park it at a local park garage for 40,000 dollars added onto your house. That isnt even worth paying for. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. She lives in this town so she knows how it is. Giving up a car can reduce stress! Boy do some people need to give up cars.

America's obeisity count is getting higher and higher by the month. What if we gave up cars? people would have to walk everywhere! That's a good way to get exercise. In passage 1 it says ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Stores are helping people out so they can walk to get what they need instead of driving.

It will be so much less expensive in everyday life if you dont have a car. You won't have to pay for gas, you won't have to pay for car insurance and you won't have to pay for mantanence! You also will not have to pay something crazy like ""40,000, along with a home."" If I had to pay that much more money to keep up with a car, I would give it up in an instant. I barely have enough money to support the car alone, there is no way i can pay an extra 40,000 dollars!

Not having a car seems easier and healthier to me! You can walk more, so you get you exercise in everyday. You dont have to spend money on the car, no gas, no insurance and no mantanance! That means you can spend it on important stuff, perhaps on schooling! You also dont have as much stress on your hands. You dont have to worry about stopped traffic because you can just walk, ride a bike, or jog to where ever you have a desire to go. I say we get rid of cars all together in the United States of America."
bc857771,1,"The Electoral College is a process by which we vote for electors not actually the president themself. When you vote for the electors, they decide who will be the president. We, as voters, have a right to be able to vote for whomever we choose not someone to choose for us. We should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote because it gives the people a say in who runs our country, an easier way to elect persons into office, and no one state has more of a say.

Many poeple believe that we are voting for the president when we vote for our electors, but in reality, we are voting for them to vote. We, as the people of the United States of America, have always had the right to freedom freedom of speech, religion, ect. so why don't we have the freedom to directly choose our president? In the source, the Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defences of the system are wrong', it states ""...voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This means that we do not vote directly, only for someone else to decide our fate. Written in the text fo the first source, 'What Is the Electoral College?', it reads ""...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" With this method, we are never getting results directly, only becoming the middleman when we should be front and center.

Most think that if we have electors we won't have as much trouble getting a person in office. In the eleventh paragraph, in source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defences of the system are wrong', under what's wrong with the electoral college', its speaks of a ""disaster factor"". The ""disaster factor"" is when we vote for electors and they defy the will of the people as this had almost happened with segregationists, nearly making the popular vote for Kennedy not go to Kennedy. As well as the fact that we could easily of had a tie in the electoral vote. As it says in the second source, the matter would fall into the hands of the House of Representatives ""...the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" This means each state has one vote, meaning the will of the people wouldn't have much say in the election.

People in a state all have the same electors, made by a popular vote, practically taking away the people's voice. If things were to change to popular vote we would all have a say in each election. In the Electoral College way of voting, it is ""...unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state."" Along with the fact that in the Electoral College way, the amount of electors is based on population, making the people of a small state insignificant. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all..."" If all small states stay this way, they may never be able to have a say in any big decision made by the public.

In conclusion, we, as the people of the United States of America, need to inderstand that the road we are headed down with the Electoral College, is not a good road. We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they're own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another."
540af857,1,"I believe that the electoral college is an outdated system of voting, and that we should get rid of it. If we removed the electoral college, votes could be counted much quicker, and more accurately. Our system now is outdated, and needs to be replaced with something different.

The electoral college was established in a time where technology was very primitive, and votes had to be taken as a general consensus, because counting hundreds of thousands of votes would take a large amount of time and was impractical. In current time though, counting single votes is much faster and accurate than going through the process of the electoral college. A large poll could be taken that digitally stores the votes of citizens quickly and safely. The electoral college is not very accurate either. For example, as stated in source 2, Al Gore won the popular vote, but loss due to the way that the electoral college works. Many citizens feel as if their vote doesn't matter, because they aren't directly voting for a candidate, they're voting for electors that will vote for a candidate.

The thought that in a democracy, that the voting system that we use to pick our ""leader"" is a winnertakeall ideology is absurd. If we are to keep the electoral college, we must change the way that the electoral vote system works. We must change it so that it is no longer winnertakeall, and make it so that a certain percentage of votes goes the party that the vote is for. For example, if 50% of people voted for rodney, and 50% voted for Obama, we should split the electoral votes right down the middle, so that the amount of electoral votes a candidate gets reflects their popular vote. Many presidents focus on larger states, which is understandable due to the fact that they have more votes, but if we change the way that the votes work, the candidate that focuses on many smaller states can stand a chance in the election.

So as you can see, if we want our future presidents to be elected fairly, our voting system must change. Whether it is completely taking away the electoral college, or just changing the way that electoral votes are counted, there must be a change. I don't think that you want to see the candidate that you voted for to lose as Al Gore did back in 2000."
af37ecf5,1,"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democraticPlumerParagraph9.

According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privileges. A poll of over 610 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be controversial though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the controversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. KennedyPlumerParagraph1011 There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.

Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronismPosnerParagraph15. If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice."
7e5c5f2f,1,"Electoral College is where we pick our state electors to choose our president. We as citizen get to help choose our state's electorss when we vote. It's a benefit to keep our Electoral College in the government system.

After all, Electoral College do have their negatives. In the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer claims that ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electorss."" We are not voting for our own president, but choosing an electorss for our own state to go on and help us vote for our United States of America's president,but with an Electoral College every state get two Senators and one House of Representatives. Which divide everything equally. Our votes are counted by our population of people. So, the Electoral College shouldn't be change.

Mainly, Electoral College help us vote for our president. In the source ""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register assert that the winner of the president is ""election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The more popular votes our states is given the higher chance that president is going to be elected. ""Majority of 270 electorsal votes is required to elect the president"" out of 538 votes for a president to win. With an Electoral College each president have to get at least 270 electors votes from all the 50 states for them to be president.

Lastly, Electoral College have no runoff elections. In the source ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner mentioned that with no runoffs there wouldn't be any ""complicate the presidential election process."" There will never be a tie votes between an election. For example, between Nixon and Clinton both got 43 percent popular votes which is a tie and hard to pick, but with an electors vote their votes are 301:370 which is a big difference.

In summary, Electoral College is a useful system in the government that should be kept in place. It has been used over the years and it would be a pain to change everything now."
5fb1b1be,0,"Cars have been around for many years and generations. People rely on cars for transportation. However, theres places where car usage is being limited because of the pollution it causes to the environment and help create a better environment for the people.

For for starters, one reason car usage is being limited is because of how much pollution it brings to the environment. According to article 2 paragraph 17, Paris usually has the most smog than any other European capital. The smog cleared enough for the French party to remove the ban of oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. This means cars have been a great cause of the smog in the city. In Bogota Colombia, thers a carfree day in act. According to article 3 paragraph 21, the goal of the day was to promote other transportation and to reduce smog. This shows that people aren't considerate when it comes to the environment and don't realize the pollution they're causing. Therefore limiting car usage is beneficial.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it can help create a healthier environment. According to article 2, people would participate in Day Without Cars regardless of weather. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" explained Bogota Mayor Antanas. The campaign brought constructs of 118 miles of bicycle paths. Parks and sport centers also grew. This demonstrates that people are determine to make the environment they live in into a better place to live. article 4 states that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year. This shows America is probably leaving driving for better alternatives for the environment and their lives. And limitation to car usage was a big key to this behaviour change.

Although driving has been abused for years, places are beginning to limit the usage of cars. Some of the reasons cars are being ban are due to the pollution is causes and it helps create a better environment for the city and people lives. Would limitations of car usage ever completely get rid of cars as a transportation."
d08837f7,0,"Cars are great, you can get from one point to another in a short amount of time, but are they really necessary? After all we have public transportation, bicycles, and our own two feet.

The advantages of car usage can be picked up by other forms of transportation, and the environment can be saved at the same time. If car usage was limited the world and its people would be much better off. There would be less pollution, a drop in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes, less accidents, and over all a healthier planet and world population.

There would be less pollution because if car usage was limited then there would be less pollutants from the gas in cars going up into the air. Source 2 provides evidence of this, from ""...days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Duffer 10 to ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Additionally many people are content with not having a vehicle, or even a licence in some cases, as shown in Source 1, 3, and 4. In Source 1 Heidrun Walter explains her view on not having a car after previously owning one, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source 3, shows his support unlimited car usage by saying how it helps the environment and the health of the people in reducing stress, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Source 4 Elisabeth Rosenthal speaks of how her own children and Mr. Sivak's son, all avoid using cars and Rosenthal's children don't even have licenses and they are 19 and 21 years old.

The health of the people in our world would improve and there would be less people diagnosed with diabetes because they would likely get more exercise. With limited car usage people would have to find other ways of transportation, which includes bike riding, skating, hiking, or public transportation. While using public transportation would not help to improve the health of the people, biking, skating, and hiking would, as some people do these things just for exercise. So if people were forced to do one of these alternative forms of transportation, they would be exercising and getting from point A to point B all in one shot.

Not only would limited car usage help peoples health by making them be more active, but it would also help by providing cleaner air. Poluted air can cause health problems, especially in the lungs, if car usage was limited, then polution would go down, so people would be breathing fresher air that would cause less lung damage.

There would be less accidents because there would be less cars on the road. The majority of the vehicles on the road would likely be public transportation too, so the drivers may be more cautious than the average driver since they have the lives of many people in their hands.

The world would be a safer and healthier place is car usage was limited."
71168011,1,"Dear State Senator, 12315 I have a very strongly worded, persuasive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an injustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College.I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.

My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in. What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a ""winner take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential candidate."" The winner take all system is not a fair way to elect a president because of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to california or Texas because those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campaign for a certain candidates. According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.

My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is because it is a ""disaster factor"", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, because it does allow the people to vote for the president or candidate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is because most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?

In conculsion, ""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2. I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or causes many disruptions in our country."
62b480e1,0,"The culture of the car has been coming to an end. With many people now choosing to have other forms of transportation. Now in Germany they are making cities where they help banned car usage. In the romantic city of Paris,France they are now starting to banned cars due to the overload of smog. The city of Bogota,colombia is having a special day where they banned cars and see the effect of now having cars for a day. The car usage is now being observed to do damage around the world and due to that now cities all over the world is now banning the car usage. This will help to have a healthier earth and healthier people. The benefits of banning cars is going to help everyone and even our beloved earth.

In Germany the people have made a city where they have given up their cars. The city I believe has a better way to maintain a healthy and cleaner environment than other cities in Germany. The banning of cars has been a great success with now people using bikes or walking as their means of transportation. Even though car ownership is permitted,the problem is that there are only two places to park which cost about 40,000 dollars along with your home. The result of that actions is that 70 percent of people do not own a car and 57 percent sold the car to live in the city. One person states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter. The citizens of this city have been feeling better about having no car you dont have the stress to have to drive you have the calm relaxing time by walking or biking. did you know that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car intensive areas in the United States.""The greenhouse gas has been a problem ever since the development of motor power cars. Now that we are able to stop it lets take that chance to help stop the greenhouse gas and to make cleaner and healthier cities.

The romantic city of paris is having a bit of a problem its that its beautiful city is now being coveres in smog due to the overuse of cars. now that Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to help clear the air they can't help to notice that when there are fewer cars being operated the smog begins to clear up. The smog has always been a problem for Paris it usually has more smog than in any European country. The article states that ""Paris has 147 micrograms of perticulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,Reuters found."" The romantic city of Paris cant be as wonderful if it always has a problem with having too much smog I believ that the cars are the ones to blame for this matter that if the city of paris bans its cars that the smog will decrease and become a the romantic city that it is. The article states that ""diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe."" That means that it is in fact the motor cars that are the ones causeing the overflow of the smog. If the the cars are able to to be banned in paris we will see a drop in the smog and Paris will return to the romantic city that it is.

The city of Bogota,Colombia has been celebrating the day without cars for over three years straight. The car free day help leave the streets of the capital city without any traffic jams. One problem of the road that many countries have in their capital city is that they have to many cars because of the tourist and the huge number of people who live there which causes traffic jams leaving cars in the streets for hours on end. They have the same problem in Brazil where they have one of the worlds worst traffic jams in history. The ones who delevoped the car free day was trying to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Someone states in the article ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The stress of having a car in a countries capital can be stressful to some people and that bikeing or walking is a way to help calm someone after a busy day at work. Due to the car free day the city states that ""uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad,smooth sidewalks, rush hour restirictions have dramatically cut traffic.""The car free day i feel is benefitting everyone from getting rid of traffic jams to clearing up the smog. The replacing of cars for bikes and walking is not so much a bad idea if it will help benefit evryone around you.

In conclusion, the car culture is now coming to its end. That nations all over the world has seen the great benefits from banning cars. The greatest effects that banning cars has is that they are helping to get rid of air pollution,stress,and the grreenhouse gas. These are all benfits for everyone it helps the ither people beside u and the environment. The romantic city of Paris was covered in smog due to cars. In Germany where they have developed a city where there is no car in sight and has everything within a walking or bike distance. The city of Bogota,Colombia making a holiday that has been going on for three years straight to have no cars for a day. The people have been seeing that the effects of having no car is wonderful and that we should all do it to better ourselves and to better out enivornment."
7405b110,0,"Cars, though useful, have negative impacts on the world. These effects can be seen from high density urban areas, and around the globe with global warming. Smog, greenhouse gasses, and stress are some of the main outputs from cars they are a useful but dangerous tool.

Smog in urban areas are a global concern, causing many cities to try to reduce the smog by putting restrictions on cars. It may be the ban of plates with even or odd numbers on certin days, or the ban of cars all together. The effect is staggering cities are becoming more and more clean. Even America, the world leader in automobiles, is showing some want to reduce car transitions in their cities. In some cities smog is a crippling thing. ""the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" in Paris this was the case, and after banning cars on certin days, the smog began to clear up.

Greenhouse gasses are causing temperatures to become more extreme. reducing cars can help save dying ecosystems or dwindling numbers of certin animals. Car free days in places like Bogota help reduce greenhouse gas, and it shows. people are driving less and less so ""many sociologist believe... people driving less will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" Stress caused by cars is just as big as a problem as smog and pollution. People who switch to cities that are designed to not use cars say that they have reduced stress compared to when they had cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" says a member of Vauban, a city desined with no cars in mind.

With all of this information wse might be able to help fix the world, by reducing the cause of the problem. Smog stress and Greenhouse gasses are on the decline thanks to less and less people driving."
47e743a7,0,"The extensive use of car transportation is setting a cloud over our society, literally. Car transportation is so heavily depended on in the current generation that people don't realize the negatives it has on our environment, local businesses, and people's lives in general. transportation is not a priority and there are numerous advantages to gain out of limiting the use of cars the smog percentages in the atmosphere will decline and create an everlasting clear environment and magnificent clarity built skies, local businesses that are run by families in suburbs will see their popularity rising back up to their previous points before malls in distant areas took over, the stress of supporting a cars expenses will be relieved, and people will realize that we connect just as well through the internet rather than driving to meet friends.

Although cars are used by a vast amount of the population, the impact it has on the environment is withoutadoubt an ongoing situation that needs to be taken care of. The author states in the passage that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. That should automatically tell you that these vehicles are putting an impact on our environment. Limiting the permission that citizens have of using their cars temporarily has shown a massive decrease in the smog build up that takes up a rather large percentage in most cities, in source 2, paragraph 12 the author states the outcome of Paris permitting drivers with evennumbered licenses from driving this saw smog levels clear up enough to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. If only temporarily holding people back from driving can affect our environment so positively, imagine what the output would be if the world repeated this action on a much larger scale.

Furthermore, cars promote the popularity of malls, which takes away the attention from numerous local businesses. These local stores are ran by families that need customers to keep their system alive, and if cars are traveling a further distance to reach malls, it just takes away the money needed by these local businesses. Living in small communities and suburbs is a great solution to this problem and has proven to work already, for instance The suburb of Vauban, Germany stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant high way.

Another advantage of limititing car usage would be the lessening of stress, so many people have the burden of paying expensive car bills and having to work more than one job just to keep up with the numerous payments cars require, accidents are also caused by the massive amount of cars that are already in use on the roads. If people would carpool more often or take public transporations such as buses and trains, we would see an immense improvement of families income and we'd expect a safer society as a whole, safer from the hazards caused by the humongous majority of vehicle transportation. Having a car isn't a priority, working a job close to home and using bus transportation will be benfitial to your community, just plan out your approach and you'll soon understand why having a car isn't always necessary.

All in all, putting a stop to the extensive of cars will mainly bring out the pros, people always say they want to see the world become less polluted and free from toxic gases, limiting car usage is the first step to achieving this goal as we'd see smog in our skies clear out, your local businesses can step back into popularity and connect your community even more rather than traveling a far distance to reach malls. And finally, one of the main advantages would be the effect is has on you. All your money stresses will be relieved and you'll be able to focus on something more important than a car bill. The world is noticing these possibilities and we are heading for a chage on step at a time."
95d41c3e,0,"Do you know what pollution is? Have you ever taken a trip by car? Well, cars emit a significant and substantial amount of pollution into the atmosphere. Such pollution will result in a damaged atmosphere. Therefore, it is important to decrease car usage, because there are several advantages that will arise from limiting car usage.

To begin with, limiting car usage will decrease the amount of pollution in the atmosphere which will result in cleaner air and healthier cities. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer writes, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Overusing cars in the metropolis had caused the air to become extremely and dangerously polluted. The pollution had resulted in smog, a mixture of fog and pollution from cars that is very harmful. The partial driving ban that was enacted in Paris had positive effects in the city, because after one week of the partial driving ban, the smog had cleared and the ban was rescinded for certain cars. While the ban in Paris was a way to handle the destructive pollution from cars in the city, there are only a handful of regulations that are in place towards making cities less polluted. For example, in India the air is polluted to the point where one can see the pollution that resulted from smoke from cars. In the carintensive areas of the United States, passenger cars are responsible from up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. It is imperative that more regulations are enacted in the most dangerous and polluted cities. Cleaner air can only be achieved by limiting car usage around the world, especially in the most carintensive and polluted parts of the world.

The reconstruction of the ozone layer will result from limiting car usage around the world. Burning fossil fuels and cars emitting greenhouse gases have damaged the atmosphere in a colossal way. Greenhouse gases have been exponentially breaking down our atmosphere. As cars are continuously overused in many parts of the world, the danger of radiation increases as well. The connection between the destruction of the atmosphere and increases of greenhouse gases of the atmosphere will continue to be increasing until several actions are taken to prevent such disasters. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" some cities and towns have also gone as far as having suburbs where there are barely any cars in the streets. In such cities, the air is cleaner, people are healthier and there is air pollution as well as noise pollution. Unless we make more efforts to limit car usage around the world, the planet will be plagued by a poor atmosphere, irradiated locations and unhealthy people.

Finally, while cars are being overused around the world, there are a handful of efforts being done to protect our planet from pollution. People must be informed of the consequences of too much car usage. Even though there are just a handful of regulations decreasing air pollution, people must continue to limit car usage in order to receive positive effects."
ee6fb060,1,"The Electoral Colleage is not a Colleage like it sounds, but it is a process. It is a verry complex process and sofar since our government was started it is working fine, right? Well you are wrong. First, let me give a brief explanation what the electoral College is. It is a process that our government has ben using for a very long time that was started in the constitution. What it does, Each state has a number of people in it pledged to a president, such as Obama. When the people vote, it goes to those people and then they vote on who got the majority. Sometimes, this docent work. Some of these ""people"" dont stick to their pledge and vote for someone els, like if 70% of the votes were for Bill, he is supposto vote for Bill. He docent half to and can vote for Bob instead, and this is the big problem with tis method.

florida has 29 people representing it. Places such as California and Texas have 55, and 38, But if you look at places such as hawaii and Alaska, they have around 3 or voters. They have less voters because there population is less than the places with higher amounts of voters. Here is another problem, the bigger states like Texas, California, florida, etc. have a MASSIVE advantage over these places with less people. I believe that votes should be directly by how many people choose someone and whoever gets the higher vote, wins. It's WAY simpler than the way currently used and the more simple something is, the less problems occur.

One argument agenst this way of ""the higher vote wins"" is that it is possible that the votes are so close that there is no clear winner, but with the current way, if there is a tie in the electoral colleage, then it goes to the peoples votes. In 1968, if just 41,71 votes would have made it a tie, and thats extremely close. Dont YOU want to vote for the president, or would you rather vote for someone to vote for ho you want and they could be corrupt and vote for the opposite that they are supposto vote for wich has happened.

If people decided to rid of this mess of a voting system called ""The Electoral College"", wich would be a big leap to accomplish due to the ammount of supporters, would be a great accomplashment. It would also lead to those 29 people in flordia living off of doing practicly nothing and getting money having to get a real job to get money. These would be the people that try and not get rid of it and tell the good parts of it and most likley lie like most government people do, all so they can get money, withought doing practicly anything. In the 2000's, Al Gore recieved more votes than his opponent, George Bush. Bush wone even though more people wanted gore, and this happened because the Electoral College gave Bush more votes, making him win the election. Dosent is seem wrong that the people wanted Gore, but we still got Bush?

Not all of these people working in the Electoral College are like this though, Some might actuially believe it's a good idea to keep it and are a part of it not for the money. When people advertise for who to vote for, they dont advertise in Alaska or Rhode island, They advertise to the states with the most Electoral Colleage members are, such as florida, Texas, and California."
